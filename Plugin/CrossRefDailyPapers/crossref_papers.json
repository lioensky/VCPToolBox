    "abstract": "AbstractThe heavy reliance on fossil fuels results in excessive greenhouse emissions, exacerbating environmental change, and global warming. CO2 electrocatalysis has been widely studied and the products are limited to C1‐2. Herein, we reported the integration of electrocatalysis and microbial catalysis for the synthesis of fatty acids from CO2. Here, we compared two decoupled MESs for fatty acid production, electrocatalysis‐purification system (System I), and direct‐electrocatalysis system (System II). Firstly, an upstream electrolysis was used to reduce CO2 to formate using KHCO3 and medium as electrolyte, respectively, with carbon nanofiber supported bismuth (Bi@PCF) catalyst. The results indicated that KHCO3 as electrolyte had higher formate yield and Faraday efficiency than that of medium. Subsequently, a downstream microbial catalysis composed of Cupriavidus species was employed to synthesize fatty acids from formate in System I and System II, respectively. It was demonstrated that System I with the yield of 1.006 mg L−1 was more favorable for the synthesis of fatty acids than System II with the yield of 0.349 mg L−1. These results suggested that decoupled electrochemical and microbial catalysis were an efficient approach for fixing CO2, indicating the great potential of a renewable energy driving artificial photosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial and fungal leaf diseases significantly impact the productivity of agricultural, which causing annually billions of dollars in crop losses and threatening global food security. Conventional detection methods even though effective, but they are labor intensive, consuming more time, and inappropriate for real time applications or large-scale ones. In order to address the limitations of other studies, this study proposes an AI solution that using a fine-tuned ResNet50 model trained on the PlantVillage dataset to classify the plant leaves as Healthy, Bacterial, or Fungal (Mold). The model was optimized using TensorFlow Lite and deployed on a Raspberry Pi 4, achieving 87% accuracy, a recall of 86%, and inference speeds around 1.2 to1.5 seconds per image. To enhance the overall generalization, the data augmentation techniques were applied which including rotation, flipping, and scaling. For early disease detection in agricultural and environmental applications, this research provides a scalable and a cost effective. Compared to traditional methods and other systems, this study provides faster inference speeds and lower costs, making it ideal for designs with limited resource.",

    "abstract": "Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) based on packet signatures are widely used in network security but often fail to detect previously unseen attacks. To overcome this limitation, machine learning-based methods have been explored to identify anomalous patterns in network traffic indicative of unknown intrusions. In this study, we propose an IDS model based on the Long Short-Term Memory Autoencoder (LSTM-AE), specifically a Convolutional Neural Network Bidirectional LSTM Autoencoder (CNN-BiLSTM-AE). The model integrates convolutional layers for spatial feature extraction and bidirectional LSTM layers to capture temporal dependencies in both directions. By leveraging CNNs to extract key spatial features and BiLSTM to model sequential patterns, the proposed architecture enables effective differentiation between normal and malicious traffic. Anomalies are detected by computing reconstruction loss during inference and applying a predefined threshold to classify traffic. The experimental results demonstrate that the CNN-BiLSTM-AE model achieves high detection performance, with an accuracy of 98.1% and an F1-score of 98.3%, highlighting its effectiveness in identifying previously unknown intrusions.",

The results showed that the ML varieties exhibited significantly lower moisture but higher starch contents than those of CL. Meanwhile, the rhizosphere fungal richness of ML was also significantly higher than that of CL. Moreover, the relative abundances of bacterial phyla and genera, such as Nitrospirota, Bacteroidota, Proteobacteria, and Bacillus, alongside fungal phyla and genera, i.e., Ascomycota and Emericellopsis, were enriched in rhizosphere of ML compared to CL. Functional prediction also revealed that elevated nitrogen cycling, polysaccharide degradation and cellulose breakdown functions could be detected in ML, potentially driving starch accumulation and cell wall modification. These results suggest that rhizosphere microbial composition, particularly nitrogen-cycling bacteria and lignocellulose-degrading fungi, may contribute to texture formation between texture-differentiated lotus root varieties.",

Among the various sources used in liquid biopsy, platelets and their RNA stand out as a unique diagnostic tool, reflecting the body’s systemic response to cancer. However, during laboratory platelet extraction known as platelet washing, white blood cells (WBCs) retention can occur, potentially confounding platelet-derived RNA sequencing data.\n               \n               \n                  Materials and methods:\n                  To address this challenge, we developed a method to quantify WBC enrichment in platelet RNA-seq datasets. Using the largest publicly available dataset (GEO GSE183635), which includes 2,351 samples from cancer patients, healthy donors, and individuals with benign, non-cancer conditions, we identified 3 sample clusters based on leukocyte marker levels. This allowed us to differentiate two entirely distinct sets of samples, with the lowest and the highest WBC retention, containing 377 matched samples in each set. We then assessed how the leukocyte presence influences the performance of machine learning models for cancer classification for the low and high leukocyte subgroup.\n               \n               \n                  Results:\n                  Across the full test set (n=453), our model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94.

Despite therapeutic advances in recent decades, survival rates have remained largely unchanged. A major contributing factor to poor outcomes is the lack of a non-invasive screening test for HNSCC, as well as the high recurrence rates within two years of curative therapy. In this study, we aimed to leverage elastic net penalized regression to identify and validate DNA methylation biomarkers for HNSCC using non-invasive oral rinse samples.\n               \n               \n                  Methods:\n                  Oral rinse methylation data from the Collaborative Study of Head and Neck Diseases (CoHANDS), a large population-based case-control study of HNSCC in the greater Boston-area, was used for biomarker discovery. Data was split 3:1 into training and test datasets. Elastic net hyperparameter optimization with five-fold cross validation and model fiting was conducted on the training data set. Performance of the resulting model was evaluated in the test data. Data splitting and model fitting was repeated over 1,000 iterations. Performance metrics and the features selected by the model were collected for each iteration. Two approaches were employed: (1) a locus-by-locus analysis and (2) an analysis based on the average methylation values across CpG-dense regions identified via Hidden Markov modeling. Biomarker panels for each approach were selected to optimize predicted performance and parsimony. The identified biomarker panels were externally validated for discriminatory performance using tissue biopsy methylation data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Additionally, the biomarker panels were evaluated for their ability to predict recurrence in post-treatment oral rinse samples collected at the University of Cincinnati, which were interogated using the Illumina HumanMethylation EPIC BeadChip.\n               \n               \n                  Results:\n                  To optimize accuracy while maintaining model simplicity, biomarker panels derived from an α = 0.7 within the elastic net model were selected for further analysis. The individual CpG panel consisted of 14 CpG loci, while the CpG-dense region panel contained 10 CpG-dense regions. Validation using HNSCC methylation data from TCGA demonstrated high discriminatory performance, with AUCs of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.92–1.00) for the CpG-dense region panel and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.97–1.00) for the individual CpG panel. Prospective prediction of recurrence was more modest, with AUCs ranging from 0.83 (95% CI: 0.64 – 1) for the CpG-dense region panel to 0.76 (95% CI: 0.40 – 1) for the individual CpG panel when restricted to patients with a recurrence &amp;lt; 6 months prior to the last provided sample.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions:\n                  The biomarker panels demonstrated excellent performance in distinguishing tumor tissue from paired normal tissue using TCGA data, with promise in predicting recurrence in post-treatment oral rinse samples. These DNA methylation biomarker panels may provide a novel screening method for HNSCC diagnosis or early identification of recurrence.\n               \n               \n                  Citation Format:\n                  Alexander C.

The chapter focuses on the long-term strategies (LTS) submitted by Nigeria, South Africa, Ethiopia, The Gambia, and Zimbabwe. The analysis involves asking questions about the plots, actors, discourses, and gaps in these long-term strategies, and the chapter argues that these are all statist, developmental, technology-focused, and largely depoliticized ecopolitical imaginaries. There are some important shared silences in the ways that they envision what low carbon development entails, how to get to net zero, and the political implications for democracy, subjectivity, and ecology, and none of the strategies make a strong case for climate reparations or the climate debt owed by the Global North to the Global South.",

    "abstract": "AbstractBACKGROUNDPoria cocos is a renowned medicinal and edible macrofungus in China. Alkali‐soluble polysaccharide from Poria cocos (PCY) is one of its main active components. However, the biological activity and utilization of PCY are constrained by its poor water solubility. Therefore, we modified PCY with chlorosulfonic acid–pyridine to improve its properties in this study. By comparing the results of solubility, antioxidant and hypoglycemic assays, we chose one derivative for further studies, which was named PCY‐S2. We simulated in vitro the digestion and microbial fermentation of PCY‐S2 using feces from volunteers and then gavaged it to mice to investigate its impacts on gut microbial modulation.RESULTSThe results showed that PCY‐S2 could effectively regulate gut microbiota in fecal fermentation and animal experiments. In in vitro microbial fermentation, PCY‐S2 upregulated the abundance of probiotic bacteria such as Streptococcus, Bifidobacterium and Lactococcus. In in vivo microbial studies, PCY‐S2 downregulated the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidota at the phylum level, significantly increasing the relative abundance of several beneficial microbiota such as unclassified_f_Muribaculacea, Prevotellaceae_UCG‐001 and Alloprevotella at the genus level. Also, it promoted short‐chain fatty acid production and reduced the levels of IL‐6 and TNF‐α.CONCLUSIONOverall, PCY‐S2 is beneficial for regulating the composition and structure of gut microbiota, which provides a candidate for developing an effective functional prebiotic. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.",

    "abstract": "Existing log-based anomaly detection methods typically require large volumes of labeled data for training, presenting significant challenges when applied to new systems with limited labeled data. This limitation has spurred the need for cross-system log anomaly detection (CSLAD) methods. However, current CSLAD approaches often face challenges in effectively handling distributional differences in log data across systems. To address this issue, we propose ELFA-Log, a transfer learning-based approach for cross-system log anomaly detection. By enhancing pseudo-label generation with uncertainty estimation and feature alignment, ELFA-Log improves detection performance even in the presence of data distribution shifts. It uses entropy-based metrics to generate high-confidence pseudo-labels, minimizing reliance on labeled data. Additionally, a distance-based loss function optimizes the shared representation of cross-system log features. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ELFA-Log enhances the performance of CSLAD, offering a practical solution to the challenge of high labeling costs in real-world applications.",

Screening reduces cancer mortality through early detection, but only 59% of eligible individuals are up to date with recommended CRC screening. Non-invasive and more convenient tests can increase adherence to screening guidelines, and blood tests using next generation sequencing to detect cancer-associated methylation patterns in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) have recently shown great promise and are on track to or have recently achieved FDA approval. Such tests produce data for millions of cfDNA fragments (and billions of bases) per sample and require sophisticated featurization and classification algorithms. Deep learning (DL) outperforms traditional machine learning (ML) given enough training data, but application to blood-based cancer screening remains challenging due to the immense input space and low training case counts. Here, we present an interpretable fragment-level DL model that outperforms a state-of-the-art ML approach.\n               \n               \n                  Methods:\n                  Each sample yields millions of fragments represented as a multimodal feature based on nucleotide sequence, CpG methylation pattern at single-base resolution, and other biologically relevant characteristics. Our DL model first learns a fragment embedding; then, a specialized attention mechanism uses cancer-indicative fragments to learn a sample embedding. Finally, the sample embedding is used to predict CRC status. To assess classification accuracy, we used two independent test sets: challenging contrived positive material (plasma from an advanced-CRC subject diluted into plasma from healthy controls to a level just above the detection limit, n = 148); and a research cohort of patients with CRC (n = 211) or harder-to-detect advanced precancerous lesions (APLs, n = 388).\n               \n               \n                  Results:\n                  We trained DL models using 70% (DL1) or 100% (DL2) of available training data (925 cases; 3,469 controls). For each model, we set a classification threshold to yield 90% specificity in test-set controls (n = 331). DL2 was more sensitive than the ML model in contrived positives (82% vs 70%), CRCs (90% vs 88%), and APLs (30% vs 27%).

We hypothesized that genomic alterations could inform patient-specific tumor dynamics and developed an integrated computational framework to test this relationship. We analyzed 844 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with Osimertinib who underwent MSK-IMPACT gene profiling (505 cancer-related genes tested for mutations, copy number alterations, and rearrangements). Longitudinal tumor measurements were extracted from radiology reports using our validated natural language processing (NLP) algorithm. We modeled tumor dynamics using an ordinary differential equation (ODE) system capturing sensitive and resistant cell populations, with parameters estimated through a novel genomics-informed Bayesian hierarchical framework. This approach clusters patients based on genomic alteration profiles and prioritizes information from patients with dense measurements (≥4 timepoints) to inform parameter estimation in patients with sparse data. The latter mitigates the risk of identifiability issues in patients with sparse measurements. The NLP method achieved 95.2% accuracy in tumor size detection and 94.9% accuracy in location matching against 62 manually annotated cases. Principal component and K-means analysis identified four patient groups with distinct alteration frequencies in TP53, RB1, CTNNB1, SMAD4, and PIK3CA (Fisher’s exact test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction; all p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Hierarchical parameter estimation of the ODE model revealed significant inter-cluster differences in growth rates (Kruskal-Wallis, H=9.01 and 10.83, both p&amp;lt;0.05), treatment response (Kruskal-Wallis, H=21.04, p&amp;lt;0.001), and the estimated initial resistant cell fraction (H=26.92, p&amp;lt;0.001). In particular, clusters enriched in TP53 alterations had higher treatment response rates; however, they tended towards a higher resistance growth rate compared to other genomic subgroups. Our integrated framework combining automated tumor size extraction with genomics-informed hierarchical modeling uncovered distinct tumor dynamics across genomically defined NSCLC subgroups. This approach lays the foundation for the prediction of treatment response trajectories from baseline molecular data—potentially facilitating personalized lung cancer treatments and follow-up guidance based on patient-specific tumor trajectories.\n               \n               \n                  Citation Format:\n                  Nikolaos M.

In this work, we integrate extensive genomic information with hydrography and water mass age to delineate microbial taxonomic and functional boundaries across the South Pacific. Prokaryotic richness steeply increases with depth in the surface ocean, which forms a so-called phylocline, below which, richness is consistently high, dipping slightly in highly aged water. Reconstructed genomes self-organize into six spatially distinct taxonomic cohorts and 10 functionally distinct biomes that are primarily structured by wind-driven circulation at the surface and density-driven circulation at depth.

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The CRISPR-Cas12b system has revolutionized molecular diagnostics, yet its reliance on single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) exceeding 100 nt limits precise regulation and applications. We present a split sgRNA strategy for Cas12b, utilizing universal components with customizable Spacer to detect various nucleic acid targets by simply replacing Spacer. Glyoxal labeling of the universal split direct repeat (DR) region represses Cas12b activity, which is restored by elevated temperatures or prolonged incubation, enabling dynamic regulation. Incorporating a photo-cleavable linker into the DR allows UV-mediated modulation, ensuring compatibility with recombinase polymerase amplification. Successful detection of Epstein-Barr virus in clinical plasma samples matched the sensitivity of traditional qPCR. Importantly, microRNAs can replace the Spacer, enabling direct detection without reverse transcription or amplification. Supported by evidence from cultured cells and plasma from healthy individuals and colorectal cancer patients, this method yields consistent results with RT-qPCR while simplifying protocols. This split strategy enhances Cas12b systems, offering a promising approach for clinical nucleic acid analysis.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionVisualizing normal parathyroid glands (PTGs) using ultrasound (US) has historically been challenging. This study aims to assess the detection rate of normal PTGs in thyroid patients and evaluate their echostructure, anatomical location and their relation with the underlying thyroid pathology.MethodsA retrospective observational study was conducted over four weeks (September–October 2024) at the Thyroid Unit of Ente Ospedaliero Cantonale (EOC). Consecutive thyroid patients undergoing US for any thyroid indication were included, while those with a history of parathyroid disease, chronic kidney disease, or recent thyroid surgery were excluded. The primary outcome was the detection rate of normal PTGs. Secondary outcomes included PTG echostructure, anatomical location, and correlations with patient characteristics (age, gender, BMI, thyroid volume, and underlying thyroid pathology).ResultsNormal PTGs were identified in 45.1% of patients (n=51). Most PTGs were located near the lower pole of the thyroid lobes and appeared mildly hyperechoic. Thyroid volume was inversely associated with PTG detection (p=0.001), while underlying thyroid pathology (e.g., thyroiditis, nodular disease) had no significant impact on detection rates.ConclusionNormal PTGs can be visualized using US, particularly near the lower thyroid poles. Detection rates decrease in patients with larger thyroid volumes or athyreotic status. These findings confirm and expand on recent studies, challenging the historical belief that normal PTGs are undetectable, with potential implications for endocrine imaging and surgical planning.",

    "abstract": "Remote sensing object detection (RSOD) models are widely deployed on edge devices for critical applications. Their security and integrity have become urgent concerns. This work proposes a fragile model watermarking method that enables black-box integrity verification for RSOD models. Specifically, for a given RSOD model, we construct class-specific sensitive object triggers and corresponding fragile watermark samples for each target category. During the trigger generation process, a trained surrogate model is first employed to construct the initial sensitive object trigger, where real objects are utilized to guide the trigger to acquire weak semantic features of the target class. This trigger is then jointly optimized using both the original model and a tampered version. The original model ensures that the trigger remains recognizable, while the tampered model encourages sensitivity to parameter changes. During integrity verification, the model is queried with all the fragile watermark samples. The model is considered intact only if all predictions match the expected results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is effective across multiple RSOD models. It exhibits high sensitivity to various model modifications, including backdoor injection, fine-tuning, pruning, random parameter perturbation, and model compression.",

    "abstract": "Objective: This study aims to investigate the feasibility of an online music therapy protocol for individuals previously diagnosed with COVID-19, focusing on their perceptions of their respiratory symptoms and the intervention’s impact on psychosocial measures. Methods: A within-subject experimental design was applied to examine an eight-week weekly online music therapy protocol, including singing, wind instrument playing, and music visualizations. All self-report data were collected bi-weekly throughout the 16-weeks study period, including baseline and post-tests. The measures for respiratory symptoms included the Medical Research Council’s Dyspnea Scale (MRC Dyspnea), Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire-Mastery Scores (CRQ Mastery), and Visual Analogue Scale for breathlessness. The measures for the secondary psychosocial outcomes were the Beck Depression Inventory-Short Form, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Fatigue Severity Scale, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level, and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. Results: Twenty-four participants were enrolled. The participants perceived a reduction in respiratory symptoms, and shortness of breath (MRC Dyspnea). Planned comparisons showed significant decreases in MRC from baseline to post-treatment (p = 0.008). The mixed-effects model, including pre-baseline and post-treatment, was significant (p &lt; 0.001). Significant changes in Breathing VAS were consistent with improvements in MRC Dyspnea, showing a significant baseline-to-post difference (p = 0.01). The CRQ Mastery showed significant improvements from baseline to Week 12 (p &lt; 0.001). No significant changes were observed in other secondary measures. Conclusions: Our preliminary findings suggest that this protocol is feasible, and as a result, may help individuals previously diagnosed with COVID-19 to cope with lasting respiratory symptoms and improve their perception of shortness of breath. Live music-making, including playing accessible wind instruments and singing, may contribute to an increase sense of control over breathing. As this was a feasibility study, we conducted multiple uncorrected statistical comparisons to explore potential effects. While this approach may increase the risk of Type I error, the findings are intended to inform hypotheses for future confirmatory studies rather than to draw definitive conclusions.",

At this frequency, the shell has a measured flux density of 72.2±7.2 mJy. Using previous Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) measurements at 2.4, 4.8, and 8.64 GHz, as well as the EMU observations of the star itself, we determine a spectral index of α = +0.74 ± 0.02, indicating thermal emission. We propose that the shell and star both exhibit thermal emission, supported by the its appearance in near-infrared and Hα observations. The latest Gaia parallax is used to determine a distance of 2.28 ± 0.09 kpc. This star is well-known for its surrounding circular nebulosity, and using the distance and an angular diameter of 8′.42, we determine the shell size to be 5.57±0.22 pc. We use the Gaia proper motions (PMs) of WR16 to determine peculiar velocities of the star as Vα(pec) = –45.3±5.4 kms–1 and Vδ(pec) = 22.8±4.7 kms–1, which indicates that the star is moving in a north-west direction, and translates to a peculiar tangential velocity to be 50.7±6.9 kms–1. We also use these PMs to determine the shell’s origin, estimate an age of ∼ 9500 ±1300 yr, and determine its average expansion velocity to be 280 ± 40 km s–1. This average expansion velocity suggests that the previous transitional phase is a Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) phase, rather than a Red Super Giant (RSG) phase. We also use the measured flux at 943.5 MHz to determine a mass-loss rate of 1.753 × 10–5M⊙ yr–1, and use this to determine a lower-limit on ionising photons of NUV &gt; 1.406 × 1047 s–1.",

MARVINA is an AI-powered chatbot designed to facilitate symptom management for breast cancer patients. We aim to incorporate psychosocial risk detection features into the chatbot to help identify patients in need of additional psychosocial support or intervention, and to deliver tailored resources accordingly. To explore this functionality, we developed a module to perform emotional tone classification of patient text input.\n               \n               \n                  Methods:\n                  We cleaned an annotated corpus of 3,750 messages drawn from a Mendeley dataset of patient and caregiver posts across five cancer types (brain, colon, liver, leukemia, lung), sourced from Reddit, DailyStrength, and HealthBoards. We categorized posts with a four-item emotional tone scale: very negative (n=1,000), negative (n=1,000), neutral (n=1,000), and positive (n=750). Using a 70/15/15 training/validation/testing split, we fine-tuned a pre-trained DistillBERT classification model—originally trained on a five-item scale (very negative to very positive)—while applying class weights to address label imbalance. To simulate the informal structure of real-world conversations and deepen comprehension, we expanded the model’s vocabulary to include emojis, newlines, emails, URL links, and resized the embedding layer accordingly. Recall, precision, accuracy, and a confidence score—derived from the softmax output of the model’s final layer—were computed for each prediction.\n               \n               \n                  Results:\n                  Evaluations suggest strong model performance in distinguishing emotional tone, with particularly high precision for very negative content and high recall for neutral content. Metrics for very negative (89%/86%), negative (79%/86%), neutral (91%/84%), and positive (82%/85%) are presented in (precision/recall) format. The model attained an overall accuracy of 85% across all classes. For example, the input “I’m feeling much better today after the treatment 😊. Hope everything will go well in the future!” was classified as positive with 90% confidence. The input, “I'm exhausted. The chemo is unbearable, and every day feels worse than the last. I’ve lost my hair, my strength, and honestly, my hope.” was classified as very negative with 83% confidence.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions:\n                  Our module represents an innovative step toward leveraging AI for emotional tone classification in oncology care, laying the groundwork for enhanced mental health monitoring and risk detection within chatbots, while supporting patient self-management in cancer care. Future directions include exploring psychosocial risk evaluation by implementing tailored chatbot responses and automated alerts to care teams in response to very negative or recurrently negative inputs. Conversely, messages that promote resilience and self-efficacy could be used to reinforce a positive tone.\n               \n               \n                  Citation Format:\n                  Nissim Maxim.

    "abstract": "Little Red Dots (LRDs) are compact, point-like sources characterized by their red color and broad Balmer lines; it is a matter of debate whether they are dominated by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) or dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). Here we report two LRDs (ID9094 and ID2756) at z_ ̊m spec &gt;7 recently discovered in the JWST FRESCO GOODS-North field. Both satisfy the ``v-shaped\" color and compactness criteria for LRDs and are identified as Type-I AGN candidates based on their broad Hβ emission lines (full width at half maximum: $2280±490$ km s^-1 for ID9094 and $1070±240$ km s^-1 for ID2756) and narrow lines (≃ 300-400 km s^-1). To investigate their nature, we conducted deep NOEMA follow-up observations targeting the ̧ii,158,̊m μ m emission line and the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We do not detect ̧ii, or 1.3 mm continuum emission for either source. If the two LRDs were DSFGs, we would expect significant detections: $&gt;16σ$ for ̧ii and $&gt;3σ$ for the 1.3 mm continuum of ID9094, and $&gt;5σ$ for the ̧ii of ID2756. Using the $3σ$ upper limits of ̧ii, and 1.3 mm, we performed two analyses: (1) UV-to-far-infrared spectral energy distribution fitting with and without AGN components, and (2) comparison of their properties with the L_̊m ̧ii–SFR_̊m tot empirical relation. Both analyses are consistent with a scenario in which AGN activity contributes to the observed properties, though a dusty star-forming origin cannot be fully ruled out. Our results highlight the importance of far-infrared observations for studying LRDs, a regime that remains largely unexplored.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe extensive application of pesticides in agricultural practices is known to affect microbial health and thus eco-multifunctionality in soil. However, previous studies have mainly focused on these effects on whole microbial community in dryland, without considering that in paddy fields under flooded condition, especially lacking the finer insights into subcommunities related to niche fitness.MethodsTo address this issue, the paddy fields, managed with (HP) and without pesticide application (HH) over 8 years, were selected. Then, the occurrence characteristics, function and assembly of generalized and specialized subcommunities classified by niche fitness were investigated.ResultsThe findings revealed that compared to HP model, the microbiota under HH model displayed higher bacterial diversity in both specialists and generalists, as well as greater fungal diversity in the generalists. However, pesticide residues in HP treatment increased copiotrophic microorganisms (e.g., Gemmatimonadota) in paddy soil, whereas oligotrophic microorganisms (e.g., Proteobacteria and Acidobacteriota) were significantly reduced. This indicated a special response of microflora to pesticide application under flooded condition, challenging the traditional views. Despite these changes, HP treatment also exhibited a substantial rise in pathogenic Fusarium, implying a higher diseases risk for rice. Neutral modeling revealed that both bacterial and fungal communities in HP were primarily driven by deterministic processes. Especially for specialists, it had a homogenization selection and diffusional limitation during community succession, because it was characterized by constrained adaptability, narrow ecological niches and high resource specificity. Regarding microbial networks, HP treatment resulted in lower node degree and closeness centrality compared to HH, leading to a decline in the overall functional capacity of the microbial community. FAPROTAX functional predictions further observed a significant reduction in the genes associated with nitrogen cycle and cellulolysis, while the human disease-related genes were increased in HP treatment. Collectively, these findings reveal that pesticide application in paddy fields significantly impacts microbial community structure and function, with specialized subcommunities being particularly vulnerable. These findings broaden our understanding into assembly principles of specialists and generalists under pesticide application in flooded paddy, which will contribute to the sustainable management for rice cultivation.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionAs the years of mango cultivation progress, pathogens invade the soil, leading to the development of soil borne diseases. These diseases not only change the physical and chemical properties of the soil but also influence the diversity and composition of soil microbes, ultimately impeding the development of the mango industry. In view of this, this study aimed to explore the correlations among the physical and chemical properties of mango root soil, root exudates, soil microbial community and soil borne diseases.MethodsHealthy, diseased and severely diseased mango root soil samples were taken as the investigation objects. The main research methods were: (1)Testing seven soil physicochemical properties, such as total phosphorus and total potassium, in rhizosphere soil. (2) We determined the phenolic acid content in mango rhizosphere soil using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). (3) Soil microbial communities were analyzed using second-generation high-throughput sequencing technology. (4) The characteristics and response mechanisms of changes in soil microbial community structure were analyzed using multivariate statistical methods, such as redundancy analysis (RDA) and correlation analysis, in combination with physical and chemical environmental factors. (5) PICRUSt2 analysis of microbial community function under soil borne diseases.ResultsSoil borne disease had profound impacts on soil physicochemical properties, root exudates (phenolic acid) and microbial community structure. On one hand, with the development of soil—borne disease, the mango’s ability to absorb foreign nutrients is weakened, leading to the accumulation of nutrients in the root soil, which significantly increases total phosphorus, total potassium, alkaline hydrolysis nitrogen, acid—soluble phosphorus, available potassium, organic matter and pH value. On the other hand, soil borne disease also increased the secretion of phenolic acid in mango root, with significantly increased concentrations of vanillic acid, ferulic acid, salicylic acid and coumaric acid. High-throughput sequencing results showed that soil-borne diseases were followed by a decrease in bacterial diversity, an increase in fungal diversity, and the accumulation of pathogenic microorganisms such as Fusarium in the soil. In addition, the physical and chemical properties of the soil as well as phenolic acid exudates also influenced microbial community functioning, particularly with respect to genetic information processing, metabolism and biological systems.DiscussionIn this study, we investigated the mechanism of soil-borne diseases in mango by studying the response mechanism of soil-borne diseases with root secretion and microbial community. It provides theoretical support for the sustainable development of mango industry.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTThis study explores the long‐term consumer responses following exposure to offensive‐discriminatory advertising (ad) among members of discriminated groups. It aims to understand the dynamic consumer effect of such ads, particularly for those who feel their group is highly discriminated against and who wish to disidentify from their group. Three longitudinal experiments were conducted: race‐offensive (n = 347) and two gender‐offensive studies (n = 221, and n = 72). Offensive‐discriminatory and non‐offensive‐discriminatory ads were presented to women and Black participants, and consumer responses were measured at two‐time points. Individuals feeling highly discriminated against who tended to distance themselves from their group showed more compensatory brand responses (brand purchase intentions, actual brand choice, and Frontal Alpha Asymmetry score as a measure of approach avoidance tendency) over time than those feeling less group discrimination. This study adds to the literature by showing the temporal dynamics of disidentification triggered in responses to offensive‐discriminatory ads. It highlights the role of time in consumer behavior and quantifies long‐term responses among different segments. It also extends the disidentification theory from workplace settings to ad contexts. These studies reveal the long‐term effects of offensive‐discriminatory ads on specific consumer segments and the complex dynamics between consumers, brands, and social identities. It emphasizes the need for ethical regulation of such ads, which provoke compensatory responses from stigmatized groups.",

    "abstract": "Soil salinization severely limits global agricultural sustainability, particularly across the saline–alkaline landscapes of the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau. We examined how potassium fulvate (PF) modulates oat (Avena sativa L.) performance, soil chemistry, and rhizospheric microbiota in the saline–alkaline soils of the Qaidam Basin. PF markedly boosted shoot and root biomass, with the greatest response observed at 150 kg hm−2. At the same time, it enhanced soil fertility by increasing organic matter, nitrate-N, ammonium-N, and available potassium, and improved ionic balance by lowering Na+ concentrations and the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), while increasing Ca2+ levels and soil moisture content. Under the high-dose treatment (F2), endogenous fungal contributions declined sharply, exogenous replacements increased, and fungal α-diversity fell; multivariate ordinations confirmed that PF reshaped both bacterial and fungal communities, with fungi exhibiting the stronger response. We integrated three machine learning algorithms—least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), Random Forest (RF), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)—to minimize the bias inherent in any single method. We identified microbial β-diversity, organic matter, and Na+ and Ca2+ concentrations as the most robust predictors of the Soil Salinization and Alkalization Index (SSAI). Structural equation modeling further showed that PF mitigates salinity chiefly by improving soil physicochemical properties (path coefficient = −0.77; p &lt; 0.001), with microbial assemblages acting as key intermediaries. These findings provide compelling theoretical and empirical support for deploying PF to rehabilitate saline–alkaline soils in alpine environments and offer practical guidance for sustainable land management in the Qaidam Basin.",

    "abstract": "Capsicum (pepper) is an economically vital genus in the Solanaceae family, with most species possessing about 3 Gb genomes. However, the recently sequenced Capsicum rhomboideum (~1.7 Gb) represents the first reported case of an extremely compact genome in Capsicum, providing a unique and ideal model for studying genome size evolution. To elucidate the mechanisms driving this variation, we performed comparative genomic analyses between the compact Capsicum rhomboideum and the reference Capsicum annuum cv. CM334 (~2.9 Gb). Although their genome size differences initially suggested whole-genome duplication (WGD) as a potential driver, both species shared two ancient WGD events with identical timing, predating their divergence and thus ruling out WGD as a direct contributor to their size difference. Instead, transposable elements (TEs), particularly long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs), emerged as the dominant force shaping genome size variation. Genome size strongly correlated with LTR-RT abundance, and multiple LTR-RT burst events aligned with major phases of genome expansion. Notably, the integrity and transcriptional activity of LTR-RTs decline over evolutionary time; older insertions exhibit greater structural degradation and reduced activity, reflecting their dynamic nature. This study systematically delineated the evolutionary trajectory of LTR-RTs—from insertion and proliferation to decay–uncovering their pivotal role in driving Capsicum genome size evolution. Our findings advance the understanding of plant genome dynamics and provide a framework for studying genome size variation across diverse plant lineages.",

    "abstract": "Housekeeping and colony defense behaviors are crucial for social aphids, as they help maintain a habitable living environment and enhance their ecological adaptability. However, over the past decades, numerous studies have focused on housekeeping and colony defense behaviors in species living in primary hosts, but little attention has been given to the secondary host stage. This constrains a deeper understanding of the altruistic behavior of social aphids, as well as the ecological and evolutionary significance of such behavior. We employed indoor video recordings to document and analyze the behaviors displayed by the soldiers of the sugarcane wooly aphid, C. lanigera, on secondary hosts. C. lanigera soldiers continuously patrol around the colony to detect potential threats. When encountering potential threats or obstacles, soldiers actively initiate cleaning behavior. The soldiers use their frontal horns to disengage the hardened honeydew, corpses, or honeydew simulants (rock sugar) that are attached to the surface of host plant leaves. Subsequently, they transport these materials away from the colony using their frontal horns or forelegs, either discarding or flicking them directly. When soldiers identify obstacles—such as predator eggshells—as natural enemies, they attack them with their frontal horns. Our findings contribute to a broader understanding of altruistic behavior in social aphids and the evolutionary success of their sociality.",

High‐throughput transcriptome profiling of small EVs was performed on samples from 100 CRC patients and 50 controls, followed by extensive validation using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Diagnostic panels were developed via logistic regression and further characterized by enrolling samples from gastric cancer patients, CRC patients before/after surgery, and samples of tumor tissues/adjacent mucosa. We identified 17 molecules significantly elevated in CRC, with the highest levels in metastatic cases. Additionally, seven of them differentiated controls from precancerous lesions. Two diagnostic panels were developed, enabling early CRC detection with high sensitivity and specificity, outperforming the fecal occult blood test. Furthermore, six molecules were differentially expressed between tumor tissue and mucosa, while seven EV‐enriched molecules decreased significantly after surgery.

There remains a pressing need for accurate and cost-effective alternatives to reliably determine HRD status and guide therapeutic decisions.\n               \n               \n                  Methods:\n                  We integrated genomic and digital pathology data from 708 HGSOC patients treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK). HRD/HRP status was defined by BRCA1/2 mutation status or Myriad MyChoice genomic instability scores. Tumors were profiled using MSK-IMPACT, a targeted next-generation sequencing assay covering 505 cancer-associated genes. Genomic features included mutations (excluding BRCA1/2), copy number alterations, structural variants, pathway activations, HRD-scar metrics, and chromosomal instability signatures. Morphological features were extracted from H&amp;E-stained whole-slide images using GigaPath, a foundation model for histopathology. We trained unimodal and multimodal AI models to predict DNA repair deficiency.\n               \n               \n                  Results:\n                  Our genomic model built using MSK-IMPACT data achieved exceptionally high performance (AUC = 0.98) in identifying HRD status, highlighting its potential as a reliable and cost-effective alternative to specialized HRD assays. While combining genomic and image features did not improve classification performance, the multimodal model exhibited more compact and separable latent feature spaces, suggesting enhanced representation learning. In survival analysis, predictions from the genomics and multimodal models significantly stratified overall survival (log-rank p = 0.038 and 0.079, respectively), closely aligning with true clinical outcomes (log-rank p = 0.056). The image-only model did not significantly stratify survival (p = 0.39). Morphological features showed added predictive value when combined with specific genomic subsets—particularly structural variants (+23% AUC), mutations (+18%), and copy number alterations (+9%), demonstrating complementary information for specific genomic signals.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusion:\n                  MSK-IMPACT alone is highly accurate in identifying DNA repair deficiency in HGSOC, achieving performance comparable to commercial HRD assays while offering a more accessible and scalable solution. Although multimodal integration did not enhance classification accuracy, it improved the quality of learned representations and revealed complementary image-based signals in specific genomic contexts. These findings support the role of AI-driven multimodal approaches in enriching interpretability and biological insight in ovarian cancer stratification.\n               \n               \n                  Citation Format:\n                  Areej Alsaafin, Tom Pollard, Andrew T.

In making these substitutions and applying the EPS approach, one ultimately derives a superposition of metric structures as the relevant kinematical structure for quantum spacetime; moreover, as we will see, there is a way of interpreting these outputs in terms of branching spacetime structures.",

To scientifically and accurately grasp the gas outburst risk of the coal seam, the main parameters such as the composition, pressure, content, initial emission speed of gas, and the consistent coefficient of coal seam were measured through in-situ and laboratory tests. Then the single-index analysis method and the comprehensive indexes (D and K) analysis method were employed to scientifically determine that the No.6 middle coal seam gas shows indeed significant risk. Finally, considering the safety, economy, and time limit of the project comprehensively, an integrated outburst precaution measure of \"advanced geological prediction + grouting cut-off wall + gas pre-drainage + grouting sealing + effect verification\" in a segmented and multi-cycle manner was designed and implemented. The field application result indicates that the coal-and-gas outburst precaution measure above is scientific and effective, and can ensure the normal and safe construction of Shuidaqiao hydraulic tunnel. The research results can provide references for risk analysis of coal-and-gas outburst and its prevention and control in similar hydraulic tunnel passing through coal seam.",

In this context, this work presents a benchmarking study of standard Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures for automated skin lesion classification. A total of 38 CNN architectures from ten families (ConvNeXt, DenseNet, EfficientNet, Inception, InceptionResNet, MobileNet, NASNet, ResNet, VGG, and Xception) were evaluated using transfer learning on the HAM10000 dataset for seven-class skin lesion classification, namely, actinic keratoses, basal cell carcinoma, benign keratosis-like lesions, dermatofibroma, melanoma, melanocytic nevi, and vascular lesions. The comparative analysis used standardized training conditions, with all models utilizing frozen pre-trained weights. Cross-database validation was then conducted using the ISIC 2019 dataset to assess generalizability across different data distributions. The ConvNeXtXLarge architecture achieved the best performance, despite having one of the lowest performance-to-number-of-parameters ratios, with 87.62% overall accuracy and 76.15% F1 score on the test set, demonstrating competitive results within the established performance range of existing HAM10000-based studies. A proof-of-concept multiplatform mobile application was also implemented using a client–server architecture with encrypted image transmission, demonstrating the viability of integrating high-performing models into healthcare screening tools.",

    "abstract": "Bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) is one of the primary causes of morbidity, mortality, and economic loss in cattle worldwide. Accurate and rapid identification of causative pathogenic agents is essential for effective disease management and control. In this study, a novel multiplex fluorescence-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay was developed for the simultaneous detection of eight major pathogens associated with BRDC. The targeted pathogens included the following: bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPIV3), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine coronavirus (BcoV), Mycoplasma bovis (M.bovis), Pasteurella multocida (PM), Mannheimia haemolytica (MH), and infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBRV). The assay was rigorously optimized to ensure high specificity with no cross-reactivity among targets. The limit of detection (LOD) was determined to be as low as 5 copies per reaction for all target pathogens. The coefficient of variation (CVs) for both intra-assay and inter-assay measurements were consistently below 2%, demonstrating excellent reproducibility. To validate the clinical utility of the assay, a total of 1012 field samples were tested, including 504 nasal swabs from Farm A and 508 from Farm B in Jiangsu Province. BVDV, BcoV, PM, and MH were detected from Farm A, with a BVDV-positive rate of 21.63% (109/504), BcoV-positive rate of 26.79% (135/504), PM-positive rate of 28.77% (145/504), and MH-positive rate of 15.08% (76/504). Also, BcoV, PM, MH, and IBRV were detected from Farm B, with a BcoV-positive rate of 2.36% (12/508), PM-positive rate of 1.38% (7/508), MH-positive rate of 14.76% (75/508), and IBRV-positive rate of 5.51% (28/508). Notably, a significant proportion of samples showed evidence of mixed infections, underscoring the complexity of BRDC etiology and the importance of a multiplex diagnostic approach. In conclusion, the developed multiplex qPCR assay provides a reliable, rapid, and cost-effective tool for simultaneous detection of multiple BRDC-associated pathogens, which will hold great promise for enhancing disease surveillance, early diagnosis, and targeted intervention strategies, ultimately contributing to improved BRDC management and cattle health outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Identifying mitosis is crucial for cancer diagnosis, but accurate detection remains difficult because of class imbalance and complex morphological variations in histopathological images. To overcome this challenge, we propose a Customized Deep Learning (CDL) model, which integrates advanced deep-learning techniques for better mitosis detection. The CDL model utilizes transfer learning to counter the effects of class imbalance and speed up convergence, while skip connections are also employed to improve the localization of mitosis. Furthermore, we have established an innovative selection mechanism by the hybrid of Jellyfish Search Optimizer (JSO) and Walrus Optimization Algorithm (WOA) to maximize the momentum of the model. The proposed approach is rigorously evaluated on multiple publicly available mitosis detection datasets, including Mitosis WSI CCMCT Training Set, Mitosis-AIC, Mitosis Detection, and Mitosis and Non-Mitosis datasets. To tackle these issues, we hereby bring forth a specifically tailored Custom Deep Learning model, that assimilates hybrid CNN architecture into transfer learning and feature selection for improved mitotic detection. The CDL model comprises a Transfer Learning-based Mitosis Detection module under which extracted features from pre-trained deep networks are used to bolster feature extraction and alleviate class imbalance through skip connections to better localize mitosis. The robust assessment on a benchmark dataset displays the outstanding efficacy of the CDL model, reaching an excellent F1 score of 0.994 and accuracy of 98.8% thus proving its strength for the detection of mitotic figures. This proposed methodology can greatly empower pathologists for accurate appraisal of cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Future lines of exploration will include fusion methodologies and time efficiency for real-time applications, as well as extending CDL to various histopathological analyses.",

    "abstract": "This article was written collectively in the spirit of the commons and homemade, do-it-yourself (HADIY) creativity. It is animated by the observation that the once-radical suggestion of Raymond Williams that culture is ordinary forms the ‘commonsense’ of cultural studies. However, it argues that this remains a blind spot in the landscape of cultural policy and the creative ecology, especially as it pertains to the everyday creativity of ordinary people. The article is inspired by critical (re)engagements with sites and spaces in cultural studies which is evidenced in our work on the generative complexities of HADIY practices and sites across Australia. It derives its insights from the bounded space of a creative workshop led by zine-maker Cora Zon facilitated by the co-authors and in which they participated. Cora guided attendees through a range of introductory creative techniques to make their own zines and learn about HADIY culture. The article reflects on the zine-making workshop as a potential commons space, illustrating its insights with pages from a zine which was collectively created following the workshop and available as supplementary material to downloaded, read in physical form, preserve and share. The zine presents some of the possibilities of the form and further imagines the themes and experiences documented here, challenging the reader to ‘do-it-yourself’.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n        Coffee is among the most widely consumed beverages worldwide, with diverse Coffea species displaying a broad spectrum of flavors and important agronomic traits. Despite recent advances in genomics and the availability of assembled coffee genomes, comparative genomic analyses remain underutilized for crop improvement. In this study, we conducted comprehensive orthology and gene family evolution analyses across 24 plant species–including three Coffea species (C. arabica, C. canephora, and C. eugenioides), twelve Lamiales, and eight Solanales–to identify lineage-specific genomic features associated with adaptation and coffee quality traits. Using OrthoFinder in conjunction with gene family evolution models (CAFE5 and COUNT), we identified 1,552 orthogroups that are either specific to Coffea or have undergone significant expansion or contraction. Disease‑resistance genes were the most prominent among rapidly expanded gene families, reflecting ongoing evolutionary arms race with pathogens. We also observed asymmetric patterns of gene family evolution, including contraction of light and ethylene signaling gene families in C. canephora, contrasted by their expansion in C. arabica and C. eugenioides, which may contribute to their adaptation to shaded, high-altitude environments. Further analysis using COUNT identified twelve Coffea-specific gene family expansions associated with secondary metabolite biosynthesis, including key enzymes for caffeine and chlorogenic acid production. Our comprehensive catalog of lineage-specific orthogroups, supported by functional enrichment and phylogenetic analyses, provides a valuable genomic resource to support breeding programs focused on enhancing stress resilience, disease resistance, and cup quality in cultivated coffee.",

    "abstract": "Background: Integrating artificial intelligence into clinical photography offers great potential for monitoring skin conditions such as actinic keratosis (AK) and skin field cancerization. Identifying the extent of AK lesions often requires more than analyzing lesion morphology—it also depends on contextual cues, such as surrounding photodamage. This highlights the need for models that can combine fine-grained local features with a comprehensive global view. Methods: To address this challenge, we propose AKTransU-net, a hybrid U-net-based architecture. The model incorporates Transformer blocks to enrich feature representations, which are passed through ConvLSTM modules within the skip connections. This configuration allows the network to maintain semantic coherence and spatial continuity in AK detection. This global awareness is critical when applying the model to whole-image detection via tile-based processing, where continuity across tile boundaries is essential for accurate and reliable lesion segmentation. Results: The effectiveness of AKTransU-net was demonstrated through comparative evaluations with state-of-the-art segmentation models. A proprietary annotated dataset of 569 clinical photographs from 115 patients with actinic keratosis was used to train and evaluate the models. From each photograph, crops of 512 × 512 pixels were extracted using translation lesion boxes that encompassed lesions in different positions and captured different contexts. AKtransU-net exhibited a more robust context awareness and achieved a median Dice score of 65.13%, demonstrating significant progress in whole-image assessments. Conclusions: Transformer-driven context modeling offers a promising approach for robust AK lesion monitoring, supporting its application in real-world clinical settings where accurate, context-aware analysis is crucial for managing skin field cancerization.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThis study aims to investigate the prognostic value of integrating inflammatory biomarkers with the established Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk score for predicting clinical outcomes in patients with myocardial infarction (MI).MethodsThis prospective, single-center study enrolled adult MI patients admitted to the coronary care unit at Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University. Blood samples were collected to measure inflammatory markers (IL-1β, sIL-2R, IL-6, IL-8) and myocardial biomarkers. The Gensini score and GRACE score were calculated for each patient. The primary endpoint was the post-MI occurrence of a composite of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI, and non-fatal ischemic stroke. Predictive performance of biomarkers was evaluated using Kaplan–Meier survival curves, Cox regression analysis, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.ResultsA total of 724 patients (median age 64 years, 85.0% male) were included with a median follow-up of 1.7 years. During follow-up, 81 patients (11.1%) experienced MACE, including 45 cardiovascular deaths, 23 MIs, and 13 strokes. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that sIL-2R and IL-8 were independent predictors of MACE. Elevated levels of sIL-2R (HR = 9.123, 95% CI: 5.883–14.147, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and IL-8 (HR = 4.443, 95% CI: 2.769–7.131, p &amp;lt; 0.001) were significantly associated with an increased risk of MACE. After adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, elevated sIL-2R (adjusted HR: 3.761, 95% CI: 2.269–6.233, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and IL-8 (adjusted HR: 2.294, 95% CI: 1.375–3.825, p = 0.001) levels remained significantly associated with an increased risk of MACE. The combination of sIL-2R, IL-8, and GRACE score displayed effective predictive performance for long-term MACE, as evidenced by ROC curve analysis (AUC = 0.824, 95% CI: 0.775–0.873, p &amp;lt; 0.001).ConclusionElevated levels of sIL-2R and IL-8 independently predict increased risk of MACE in MI patients. Integrating biomarkers such as sIL-2R and IL-8 with the GRACE score can significantly improve predictive performance, offering a robust approach for risk stratification in MI patients.",

Despite extensive research, understanding the Onsager’s reciprocity of orbital transport remains elusive. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate the Onsager’s reciprocity of orbital transport in an orbital Edelstein system by utilizing nonlocal measurements. This method enables the precise identification of the chemical potential generated by orbital accumulation, avoiding the limitations associated with local measurements. We observe that the direct and inverse orbital-charge conversion processes produce identical electric voltages, confirming Onsager’s reciprocity in orbital transport. Additionally, we find that the orbital decay length, approximately 100 nm at room temperature, is independent of the Cu thickness and decreases with decreasing temperature, revealing a distinct contrast to the spin transport behavior. Our findings provide valuable insights into both the reciprocity of the charge-orbital interconversion and the nonlocal correlation of orbital degree of freedom, laying the ground for orbitronics devices with long-range interconnections.",

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for sustainable poultry production has urged the exploration of alternative feed strategies supporting animal performance and environmental goals. The first section outlines the protein requirements in broiler nutrition (19–25% crude protein) and the physiological importance of balanced amino acid profiles. Vegetal conventional protein sources are discussed in terms of their nutritional value (12.7–20.1 MJ/kg), limitations (antinutritional factors), and availability. Emerging trends in broiler nutrition highlight the integration of supplements and the need for innovative feed solutions as support for the improvement in broiler body weight and feed efficiency increase. Microbial protein sources: yeast biomass (41–60% of 100 g dry weight), microbial mixed cultures (32–76% of 100 g dry weight), and beer by-products, such as brewer’s spent yeast (43–52% of 100 g dry weight), offer promising nutritional profiles, rich in bioactive compounds (vitamin B complex, minerals, enzymes, and antioxidants), and may contribute to improved gut health, immunity, and feed efficiency when used as dietary supplements. The review also addresses the regulatory and safety considerations associated with the use of microbial protein in animal feed, emphasizing EU legislation and standards. Finally, recent findings on the impact of microbial protein supplementation on broiler growth performance, carcass traits, and overall health status are discussed. This review supports the inclusion of microbial protein sources as valuable co-nutrients that complement conventional feed proteins, contributing to more resilient and sustainable broiler production and broiler meat products.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               Many studies of preventing violent extremism argue that it emerged as a response to the 9/11 attacks. While it is true that the concept of ‘radicalization’ emerged after 9/11 in Dutch security service reports, this chapter traces the longer history of counter-extremism. Using archival research at the OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe), it shows how extremism was a matter of international concern before 9/11. The OSCE discussions of militants roving across Central Asia as a prominent threat to international security generated counter-extremism programmes and policies, including a domestic counter-extremism programme in Russia in 2000. The chapter explores how ‘extremism’ became a political football in international organizations dedicated to security after the Cold War and before 9/11. Intriguingly, Western democracies initially rejected counter-extremism as a ploy by authoritarian states to extend their control over civil society, before subsequently appropriating and transforming it post-9/11.",

    "abstract": "We present an analytical framework that describes the response of a three-dimensional (3D) half-infinite conductive space to charged perturbations that enables efficient investigation of surface-mediated phenomena. The model provides a description of charge-density-redistribution within the metal surface upon adsorption, which agrees well with an experimentally-derived CO-CO interaction potential on the Pt(111) surface. It allows for the definition of an embedding potential for relatively small metallic surface cuts that permits accurate prediction of the adsorption site preference of CO at Pt(111) surface with an arbitrary method of choice available for gas-phase calculations. We demonstrate that once embedding is applied, correct adsorption site preference can be recovered already with the well-known Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchange-correlation density functional (PBE). The method provides open-boundary treatment for metallic systems that have not been described in the literature to date. The framework is applicable to any system with smeared electron density and has a wide range of applicability, with STM images generation and adsorption site preference determination being two examples explored in the current work.",

    "abstract": "Particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) pollution poses severe threats to public health, ecosystems, and urban sustainability. With increasing industrialization and urban sprawl, accurate pollutant monitoring and effective mitigation of PM2.5 have become global priorities. Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) have revolutionized PM2.5 sensing by enabling high-accuracy predictions, and scalable solutions through data-driven approaches. Meanwhile, sustainable green technologies—such as urban greening, phytoremediation, and smart air purification systems—offer eco-friendly, long-term strategies to reduce PM2.5 levels. This review, covering research publications from 2021 to 2025, systematically explores the integration of ML models with conventional sensor networks to enhance pollution forecasting, pollutant source attribution, and intelligent pollutant monitoring. The paper also highlights the convergence of ML and green technologies, including nature-based solutions and AI-driven environmental planning, to support comprehensive air quality management. In addition, the study critically examines integrated policy frameworks and lifecycle-based assessments that enable equitable, sector-specific mitigation strategies across industrial, transportation, energy, and urban planning domains. By bridging the gap between cutting-edge technology and sustainable practices, this study provides a comprehensive roadmap for researchers to combat PM2.5 pollution.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe high voltage Padova test facility (HVPTF) is an experiment set in Padova, Italy, operating in the framework of the Neutral Beam Test Facility project of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). One of the purposes of HVPTF is to study the phenomenology of discharge events occurring between electrodes at high voltage differences over long vacuum gaps, which is crucial in the development of the neutral beam injector foreseen for ITER. The facility hosts a cylindrical vacuum vessel with stable pressure control, where two electrodes of different possible geometries can be mounted. Two independent power supplies allow for total voltage differences up to 800 kVDC with adjustable gap widths up to 250 mm. Among the diagnostics, a gas electron multiplier (GEM) detector is installed for acquisition of x‐ray emission on a radial line of sight of the vessel. This paper presents a study of the experimental sessions featuring stainless‐steel needle‐plane electrodes. The analysis is based on the GEM data, in relation to the information on current and voltage of the two power supplies. The events are characterised in terms of both temporal and spatial evolution, providing sequential emission profiles with spatial resolution of tens of millimetres on timescales of the order of hundreds of nanoseconds.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               \n                  \n                  Determining a cancer’s site of origin is essential for providing effective patient treatment, but it can be difficult if the cancer initially presents as poorly differentiated, as metastatic, or as a Cancer of Unknown Primary (CUP). Previous machine learning models have used clinical, pathological or genomic data to infer cancer types, but there has been limited work to integrate these data modalities for tumor type inference. We hypothesize that a multimodal approach enhances inference of histologic subtype. To develop this approach, we harness two pre-existing unimodal deep learning models and retrain each on a pan-cancer cohort of 40,888 tumor samples, where each sample had both hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) whole-slide images (WSIs) and matched targeted DNA sequencing data (MSK-IMPACT) available. For the H&amp;E WSIs, we use transformer model AEON (Adaptive Embedding Ontology Network), and for the MSK-IMPACT data we use hyper-parameter ensemble model GDD-ENS (Genome-Derived-Diagnosis Ensemble), to infer 110 distinct cancer subtypes as defined by their OncoTree code. ODEN (Oncotree-Diagnosis ENsemble), our multi-modal approach, combines the final probability output layers of both models using a weighted average corresponding to model training set accuracy, where inferred type represents the highest probability subtype after re-weighting. Both models achieved high weighted macro average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values on a held-out test set of 11,158 samples (AEON .988, GDD-ENS .963), and good top-1 (and top-3) accuracy scores of 68.8 (89.1) for AEON, and 64.5 (81.8) for GDD-ENS. 50% of samples were correctly inferred by both models, 20% by AEON only, and 16% by GDD-ENS only, indicating the models are complementary and multi-modal integration could improve performance. ODEN AUROC was slightly higher at .990, but accuracy greatly improved to reach 77.8 (92.3). On a subtype-specific basis, most had greater than or equal precision in ODEN when compared to GDD-ENS (99/110), or AEON (90/110). Next, ODEN was applied to a set of 5,531 samples with underspecified labels, e.g., BRCANOS or SARCNOS. 88% of ODEN inferences were in the correct organ system for the underspecified subtype (80% in AEON, 78% GDD-ENS) with highest recall within the core GI (96%) and genitourinary (93%) systems. We also evaluated 1,749 CUP samples, and found that ODEN inferences spanned 100 different subtypes, most commonly LUAD (n = 216) or PAAD (n = 210). The ODEN-inferred subtypes showed similar genomic and prognostic trends when compared to true metastatic samples of each subtype. Overall, ODEN is a multimodal tumor type inference model that improves upon prior models trained on fewer types, samples and modalities. As H&amp;E assessment is common clinical practice and DNA sequencing data is routinely collected for all patients in our institution (and rapidly expanding to others), widespread practical integration of ODEN is clinically feasible and could enable multimodal patient-specific subtype inference for diagnostically challenging cases.\n               \n               \n                  Citation Format:\n                  Madison Darmofal, Kevin Boehm, Andrew Aukerman, Arfath Pasha, Armaan Kohli, Raymond Lim, Tom Pollard, Darin Moore, Michael Berger, Nikolaus Schultz, Sohrab P.

    "abstract": "Abstract. The Weddell Sea Anomaly (WSA), a summer ionospheric anomaly over the eastern Antarctic Peninsula, was first observed in 1958 and is characterized by a nighttime peak in electron concentration instead of a the typical daytime peak. There are some works that examine long-term trends at ionospheric stations in the WSA region, but they do not do a seasonal and diurnal analysis that is vital for differentiating the periods of the anomaly. This study investigates the seasonal and diurnal variation in the long-term trend in the F2-layer critical frequency (foF2) at ionospheric stations located within the WSA region: Vernadsky (Argentine Island; 65.1° S, 64.2° W) and Port Stanley (51.6° S, 57.9° W), both with long-term foF2 data. Data from Vernadsky (1960–2023) and Port Stanley (1960–2019) were analyzed alongside data from Syowa (69.0° S; 39.6° E) and Mawson (67.6° S, 62.9° E), two stations outside the WSA influence. The analysis reveals distinct seasonal and diurnal trends. For Vernadsky, negative foF2 trends (−0.02 MHz yr−1) are observed during summer nights, coinciding with the WSA's presence. Port Stanley shows similar trends but with a secondary nighttime maximum. The WSA's influence on Vernadsky is more pronounced, with Port Stanley exhibiting a weaker mid-latitude summer evening anomaly. In contrast, Syowa and Mawson show different trends, with Syowa not having a clear trend pattern, and Mawson showing negative trends throughout the year. The study concludes that the WSA significantly affects Vernadsky and, to a lesser extent, Port Stanley. The findings highlight regional variations in ionospheric behavior and contribute to the ongoing discussion on global ionospheric trends, suggesting that local phenomena like the WSA can modulate these trends.",

However, the exact regulatory mechanism of NsdAsr on rimocidin production remains unknown.\n          \n          \n            Results\n            In this study, firstly, transcriptomic data demonstrated that the differentially expressed genes resulting from the over-expression of nsdA\n              \n                sr\n               were primarily associated with several key metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and ribosome-related genes, all of which were downregulated. This directly impacted the concentrations of CoA and NADH, as confirmed by concentration measurement assays. Subsequently, the results of the ChIP-seq experiments revealed that NsdAsr directly binds to 49 target genes. Notably, these include RS18275 and RS18290 (both involved in fatty acid degradation) as well as rpoB (related to DNA transcription). The validity of the ChIP-seq assay for these three genes was further supported by in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Regarding RS18275 and RS18290, the results revealed that the binding of NsdAsr to these elements led to the downregulation of gene expression. This, in turn, resulted in a decrease in the levels of butyryl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, which are known precursors for rimocidin biosynthesis. Consequently, this negatively impacted on the biosynthesis of rimocidin. In the case of rpoB, the results indicated that NsdAsr binding led to a downregulation of overall protein levels. This was determined by enzymatic activity of report gene GUS and Western blot assay. Consequently, this resulted in a decrease in rimocidin yield.\n          \n          \n            Conclusion\n            This study reveals NsdAsr’s dual role in limiting rimocidin production by suppressing metabolic precursors and modulating protein expression. Integrated transcriptomic and ChIP-seq analyses provide critical insights into its regulatory mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               One of the most important knowledge gaps of the antimicrobial resistance crisis is how genes spread from their environmental origins to bacteria pathogenic to humans. Our aim was to create a system that allows conducting experiments in the laboratory settings that mimic the complexity of natural communities with multiple resistance genes and mobile genetic elements circulating at the same time. Here we present a new sequence-based barcode system that allows simultaneous tracking of the spread of antimicrobial resistance gene from multiple genetic origins. We tested the concept with an experiment where we added an antimicrobial resistance gene to different genetic environments in alive and dead donor and let the gene spread naturally in an artificial microbial community under different environmental conditions as examples of factors that can be investigated. We used Emulsion, Paired-Isolation and Concatenation PCR (epicPCR) to recognise the new gene carriers and metagenomics to see a change of genetic environment. We saw the genes moving and were able to recognise the barcode from the gene sequences, thus validating the idea. We also saw that temperature and gene origin had an effect on the number of new host species. Our results confirmed that our system worked and can be further developed for more complicated experiments.",

This study aims to evaluate the potential role of rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) in detecting alterations in coagulation during and after CRS/HIPEC.MethodsA prospective observational study was conducted at a single tertiary care center. All consecutive patients undergoing CRS/HIPEC from April 2021 to December 2022 were enrolled. Participants were monitored using ROTEM, INR, PTT, and Fibrinogen at four time points (pre‐incision, post‐HIPEC, and on postoperative days 1 and 3).ResultsA total of 35 patients were included. Significant changes were observed from pre‐incision to post‐HIPEC coagulation parameters: mean fibrinogen decreased from 3.5 g/L to 2.1 g/L and mean INR increased from 1.1 to 2.1, p &lt; 0.05. By postoperative day 3, all parameters had recovered to their pre‐incision baselines, with EXTEM ML30 and fibrinogen significantly increased from baseline. Lower pre‐incision fibrinogen was significantly associated with increased intra‐operative blood loss, p &lt; 0.05. Anesthesiologists reported that intra‐operative ROTEM influenced management in 17% of cases (5/30).ConclusionsCRS/HIPEC is associated with significant changes in the coagulation profile that largely normalize by postoperative day 3. Utilizing ROTEM intraoperatively can help identify patients at risk of intra‐operative bleeding and guide transfusion strategies.",

This study examined networks of mental health concerns with the aim of identifying central issues and analyzing age and sex differences in these networks during adolescence.MethodsA total of 3723 middle and high school students (aged 11–19 years; M = 14.39, SD = 1.38; 43.6% girls) were recruited for this cross‐sectional study from May 8, 2023 to September 10, 2023, in Chongqing and Nanning, China. Loneliness, social anxiety, generalized anxiety, depression, suicidal behavior, Internet addiction, sleep quality, self‐esteem, and self‐efficacy were assessed using a questionnaire. Centrality indices were analyzed to identify the most central mental health concerns. A network comparison test was conducted to examine whether the network parameters varied by age and sex.ResultsLoneliness was the most central node regardless of age or sex. The associations between loneliness and social anxiety, as well as between suicidal behavior and sleep quality, weakened in girls as they matured. Loneliness was more strongly associated with Internet addiction in girls in middle school and with social anxiety in boys in high school.ConclusionsGiven its centrality, loneliness should be prioritized for prevention and intervention. Recognizing specific parameters of mental health concerns is essential for developing effective prevention and intervention programs for school‐aged students.",

These alterations contribute to increased myocardial stiffness (MS). Echocardiographic shear wave (SW) elastography is an emerging approach for measuring MS in vivo. SWs occur after mechanical excitation of the myocardium, e.g. after mitral valve closure (MVC), and their propagation velocity is directly related to MS.\n               \n               \n                  Objectives\n                  To investigate if SW velocities (SWV) can distinguish between interstitial and replacement fibrosis.\n               \n               \n                  Methods and results\n                  52 patients (30 heart transplanted patients [52.6±16.0 years, 80% male] and 22 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients [54.4±15.6 years, 85% male]) and 37 healthy volunteers (47.2±16.6 years, 76% male) were included. SW elastography was performed using an experimental scanner at 1172±302 frames per second. Patients were classified according to T1 mapping, extracellular volume (ECV) mapping and late gadolinium enhancement measured by cardiac magnetic resonance into three groups: no fibrosis (NF), interstitial fibrosis (MIF) and replacement fibrosis (MRF).\n                  SWVs differed among groups (p&amp;lt;0.001), with a significant post-hoc test between MIF and MRF and subjects without fibrosis (6.5±1.1 m/s and 8.7±1.2 m/s), respectively. Significant correlations were noted between SWVs and ECV values (r=0.70, p&amp;lt;0.0001) and native T1 values (r=0.48, p=0.0004). SWVs below 6.0 m/s showed the highest accuracy to identify patients without fibrosis (sensitivity 90%, specificity 90%, AUC=0.95).

    "abstract": "Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a well-conserved enzyme across Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya, known not only for its canonical role in glycolysis, but also for diverse moonlighting functions including transcription regulation, host-pathogen interactions, and immune modulation. Studying GAPDH quantitatively is crucial for understanding how subtle variations at the sequence and structural levels drive such functional diversity across evolutionary lineages. In this study, 165 GAPDH protein sequences from 158 organisms were analyzed to uncover conserved and divergent features underlying multifunctionality. While core catalytic residues were strongly preserved, selective enrichment of small non-polar residues such as valine and alanine suggested a structural basis for flexibility and adaptive potential. The balanced distribution of order- and disorder-promoting residues and the avoidance of long homopolymeric stretches indicated evolutionary selection for both structural coherence and local flexibility. Spatial distribution of amino acids in GAPDH sequences revealed low fractal variance across sequences, with moderate differences in residue clustering patterns pointing to localized adaptations without compromising overall organization. These findings demonstrate that GAPDH multifunctionality is encoded through compositional signatures and conserved spatial architecture, allowing the coexistence of metabolic stability and regulatory plasticity. The results have broad implications for understanding protein evolution, structural adaptability in extreme environments, and functional versatility in pathogenic contexts. This study establishes GAPDH as a model for exploring principles of protein moonlighting and highlights the potential of quantitative compositional analysis in uncovering hidden functional layers.",

Due to the rapid development pace of LLMs, best practices for conducting and reporting oncological research in these applications have yet to be fully established.We queried PubMed for oncology-related LLM research with the last cutoff set at Dec 31st 2024. We investigated 179 papers. Of these, 131 were removed due to omission criteria, and 48 were structured and reported here. Inclusion criteria were oncology-related research and full research articles. Structured fields included date of submission, acceptance, and publishing, the granularity of model reporting (model family, model snapshot), reporting of key LLM model parameters, availability of source code and data, and programming language and API details. We noted an almost exponential growth of LLM-related publications in oncology, with a relatively short time from authors’ submission to publicly available publication (median 3.7 months, IQR 2.5-5.9 months). Interestingly, despite the relatively short processing time, in 25% of cases, the exact model essential to the publication had been deprecated by the model service providers or a newer version was available at the time of publishing. 35.4% of published research relied solely on a graphical user-interface (GUI) of LLMs such as ChatGPT, while 37.5% reported programmatically API-use, with Python as the most common language. While most publications either fully or partially reported the utilized prompts (75%), only 22.9% reported the exact key model parameters, such as temperature. Even when the temperature parameter was available, 45.4% of these publications used a temperature value larger than 0, resulting in more stochastic answers. Source code was made publicly available in 18.7% of publications that reported using a programming language such as Python or R. While practically all publications (97.9%) reported the used model families such as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet or Llama 3-70B, only 27% reported the exact model snapshot usage such as GPT-4o with snapshot options available for May 13th, August 6th or November 20th in 2024. We exemplify and report shortcomings of recent LLM adoption in oncological research. To alleviate these issues, we propose a checklist to improve reproducibility, transparency, and longevity of LLM research directed at researchers and journals. We propose the following preliminary checklist: exact reporting of model snapshot and model parameter bound to a specific snapshot instead of latest release, API usage instead of GUI chatbots, temperature-parameter equal to 0, assessment of variability across runs, session restarts to avoid biases, and caution in researching models that are bound to be deprecated due to the short turn-around time in LLMs. Additionally, rigorous prompt engineering and especially few-shot learning show potential in optimizing interactions with LLMs, also in oncology.\n               \n               \n                  Citation Format:\n                  Tolou Shadbahr, Antti S.

Taking inspiration from Reichenbach, Hermann Weyl proposed his own ‘causal-inertial’ approach to the constructive axiomatization of Einstein’s general relativity, according to which a relativistic spacetime can be constructed solely from the trajectories of light rays and free-falling particles; this project, however, came to fruition only in 1972, with the constructive axiomatization of general relativity due to Ehlers, Pirani, and Schild (‘EPS’).\n               One century since Reichenbach, and fifty years since EPS, this book is a celebration of the constructive axiomatic methodology. It achieves four main tasks. First, it provides a thoroughgoing presentation of the EPS axiomatization, closing missing loopholes, identifying problematic axioms, and so forth—in this way, one gains a much-improved appreciation of the extent to which a causal-inertial approach to general relativity might succeed, and of what such an approach might offer. Second, it synthesies and assesses the vast but disparate literature on Constructive Axiomatics which has arisen over the past century and sets the methodology in its proper philosophical context. Third, it generalizes the approach to apply to quantum spacetimes. And fourth, it applies the approach to the context of non-relativistic spacetime physics. All in all, the book demonstrates that Constructive Axiomatics is alive and kicking; the book aims to become the go-to resource for this way of philosophising about the nature of space and time.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n        According to recent studies, feed-forward Deep neural networks (DNNs) perform better than text-to-speech (TTS) systems that use decision-tree clustered context-dependent hidden Markov models (HMMs) [1, 4]. The feed-forward aspect of DNN-based models makes it difficult to incorporate the long-span contextual influence into spoken utterances. Another typical strategy in HMM-based TTS for establishing a continuous speech trajectory is using the dynamic characteristics to constrain the production of speech parameters [2]. Parametric time-to-speech synthesis is used in this study by capturing the co-occurrence or correlation data between any two points in a spoken phrase using time aware memory network cells. Based on our experiments, a combination of DNN and BLSTM-RNN is the best system to use. Upper hidden layers of this system use a bidirectional RNN structure of LSTM, the low layers use a simple, one way structure followed by additional layers. On objective and subjective metrics, it surpasses both the traditional decision-based tree HMM’s and the DNN-TTS system. Dynamic limitations are superfluous since the BLSTM-RNN TTS produces very smooth speech trajectories.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionToddy, an alcoholic drink produced through natural fermentation, is a significant reservoir of probiotic microorganisms. Probiotics are increasingly studied for their beneficial effects in managing gastrointestinal disorders, enhancing immune responses, and promoting overall health. Lactiplantibacillus plantarum is a well-known probiotic strain as it possesses gastrointestinal survival, antimicrobial activity, and adaptability to various environmental factors. This study aims to isolate and characterize probiotic bacteria from toddy samples, with a focus on their bioactive and genomic attributes.MethodsTwenty bacterial strains were isolated from toddy samples and subjected to preliminary biochemical screening. Of these, 17 isolates were selected for further screening of antibacterial activity against foodborne pathogens. These isolates were also evaluated for probiotic traits such as auto-aggregation, hydrophobicity, tolerance to bile, acid, and NaCl. Antibiotic susceptibility was assessed against nine antibiotics. The most promising isolate was subjected to whole-genome sequencing, followed by in silico genomic analysis using BAGEL4, antiSMASH, and the KEGG automatic annotation server.ResultsAmong the 17 selected isolates, VITVTD-3, VITVTO-5, and VITVH-5 exhibited inhibitory effects against all tested food-borne pathogens. These isolates also showed moderate levels of auto-aggregation and hydrophobicity, along with the ability to withstand bile salts, acidic pH, and high salt concentrations. Antibiotic profiling revealed resistance to vancomycin in all three isolates. Antioxidant and haemolytic activity assays further supported their probiotic potential. Of these, VITVTD-3 demonstrated the most favourable combination of probiotic attributes. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that this isolate corresponds to Lactiplantibacillus plantarum strain MOVIN, possessing a genome size of 3.16 Mb and a GC content of 44.4%. Genomic analysis revealed the presence of a plantaricin operon and multiple bacteriocin gene clusters. KEGG annotation predicted 5,599 genes involved in 23 different metabolic pathways.DiscussionThe findings confirm that Lactiplantibacillus plantarum MOVIN exhibits strong probiotic characteristics, supported by phenotypic, functional, and genomic evidence. The presence of bacteriocin biosynthesis genes, along with the ability to inhibit pathogenic microorganisms and survive gastrointestinal conditions, highlights its suitability for probiotic applications. Further functional studies and safety evaluations are warranted to explore its potential use in food or therapeutic formulations.",

    "abstract": "Plants are in a dynamic web of biotic and abiotic associations, commonly called the phytobiome. Of the biotic components, the plant microbiome is at the core of managing plant health, growth, and productivity. Understanding the structure and function of microbial populations that live in association with plants is key to understanding plant-microbe interactions and their influence on crop performance. Rice (Oryza sativa L.), a food source for over half the world's population, is faced with mounting production issues with limited arable land, soil erosion and hence unsustainable agriculture. This has led to amplified application of chemical fertilizers, which is environmentally costly and has generated interest in microbial alternatives as sustainable inputs. Research indicates microbial consortia (e.g., Azospirillum brasilense, Pseudomonas fluorescens) reduce Nitrogenous fertilizer requirements by 25–40% while increasing yield by 8–12% through biological fixation and phytohormone modulation. Another study showed that inoculation of Rhizobium leguminosarum pv. Trifolii significantly promoted grain yield in rice by 47%. Despite significant research on microbial inoculants, their effective utilization is sporadic with only ~10-30% of biofertilizer trials showing reproducible yield improvements. This review considers the diversity and functional importance of the rice microbiome, in terms of its function in agricultural quality and yield. It also considers the prospect of harnessing microbial communities as sustainable biofertilizers to enhance rice productivity as opposed to dependence on inorganic means. A comprehensive understanding of the rice microbiome in a range of environmental conditions may make it feasible to design optimized microbial interventions tailored to a specific agricultural environment.",

Despite its significance, its genomic characteristics remain poorly understood. This study analysed 114 publicly available C. fetus genomes to provide global insights into genetic diversity, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and zoonotic risk.\n               \n                  Results. A total of 32 distinct sequence types (STs) were identified across 111 of the 114 C. fetus genomes, spanning 6 continents and diverse hosts (cattle, humans, sheep and reptiles). The majority of strains from cattle (75.6%, n/N=34/45) were assigned to ST-4, which was the most prevalent overall (n=45), while human-associated genomes exhibited the highest diversity with 16 STs. C. fetus subsp. venerealis (Cfv) and its biovar intermedius (Cfvi) genomes clustered closely, forming distinct branches at the biovar level; however, six Cfv genomes were located within Cfvi clades, suggesting a shared ancestry. C. fetus subsp. testudinum (Cft), primarily isolated from humans (60.0%, n/N=18/30), exhibited a more diverse genetic profile, with 20 STs. Cfv from North America and Cfvi from South America formed distinct geographic clusters, while C. fetus subsp. fetus genomes showed no clear geographic patterns, indicating global spread. Pangenomic analysis revealed substantial variation in gene presence/absence in Cft. Five AMR genes were detected, with tet(O) (n=3) being the most common. A total of 220 plasmid contigs were identified across 47 genomes, predominantly in Cfvi (66.8%, n/N=147/220) and Cfv (29.1%, n/N=64/220). Horizontal gene transfer analysis identified 140 genomic islands across 41 genomes, and virulence factor analysis revealed cheY as the sole conserved virulence gene across 35 genomes.\n               \n                  Conclusion. These findings provide critical insights into the genomic diversity, zoonotic potential and global distribution of C. fetus, emphasizing the need for integrated genomic and epidemiological strategies to assess its impact on human and animal health.",

In this study, we characterized 27 clinical bacterial isolates from double-J catheters, including Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus spp., to investigate their pathogenic potential. Our findings revealed that strong biofilm producers (E. coli, S. aureus, and B. subtilis) exhibited robust extracellular matrix synthesis. Notably, multidrug resistance was observed in E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and E. faecalis. Mixed-culture experiments demonstrated that Bacillus spp. enhanced the biofilm formation of uropathogens, suggesting a potential impact on clinical outcomes. The characterization of the polymicrobial population colonizing double-J catheters, as conducted in this study, is essential for understanding the complexity and clinical behavior of biofilm-related infections associated with medical devices. Additionally, our results highlight the clinical relevance of underreported genera, such as Bacillus, which are often overlooked in routine clinical diagnostics. Gaining insights into the interaction mechanisms and survival strategies of several bacterial species colonizing double-J catheters may help shift current paradigms in understanding catheter-related infections.",

Currently, these applications are managed by separately training specialized models on individual datasets in each specific domain. We present DirectSAM-remote sensing (RS), a foundation model built upon DirectSAM. It retains the powerful segmentation abilities acquired from natural images while leveraging a large-scale dataset designed for semantic edge detection remote sensing. The dataset contains over 34k image-text-edge triplets, making it over 30 times larger than any individual dataset. DirectSAM-RS incorporates a prompter module, consisting of a text encoder and cross-attention layers added to the DirectSAM architecture, enabling flexible conditioning on target class labels or reference expressions. We assess DirectSAM-RS in both zero-shot and fine-tuning scenarios, showing that it delivers state-of-the-art results on various downstream benchmarks.",

However, their detection remains challenging due to their extreme rarity and phenotypic fluidity, partially overlapping with the phenotype of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) and other cells found in the bloodstream.\n               \n               \n                  Materials and Methods:\n                  To address the classification uncertainty of individual CTCs, we combined our previously developed machine learning (ML) models with a marker-based strategy. We utilized a publicly available dataset (GEO GSE109761), which included 262 annotated CTCs, 14 CTC–PBMC clusters (treated as CTCs), and 82 PBMCs. Our most effective ML model used only 67 features and achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.95 (in differentiating between CTCs and other cells) on a test set comprising 132 CTCs, 43 WBCs, and 6 CTC–PBMC clusters. Subsequently, we applied this model to a single-cell dataset derived from breast cancer patients, which included 6 patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), 2 with Luminal B HER2-negative, 2 with Luminal B HER2-positive, and 3 control patients with non-malignant conditions. Given the unexpectedly high number of predicted CTCs (up to 600 cells per sample), we refined our selection using a marker-based filtering approach. From the GEO dataset, we selected CTCs exhibiting epithelial or mesenchymal phenotypes and compared them with PBMCs to identify the 100 most discriminative genes. These markers were then used to score cells in the breast cancer dataset using the UCell R package. Cells lacking leukocyte-associated scores but showing epithelial or mesenchymal scores exceeding those found in control samples were retained as candidate CTCs.\n               \n               \n                  Results:\n                  We identified 5 CTC candidates with epithelial phenotype, 2 with mesenchymal phenotype, and 5 with an intermediate phenotype.\n               \n               \n                  Discussion:\n                  While definitive classification of cells as CTCs cannot be confirmed, our integrative strategy, combining robust ML predictions with a stringent marker-based refinement, enhances the confidence in their identification.\n               \n               \n                  Citation Format:\n                  Michał Sieczczyński, Krzysztof Pastuszak, Anna Supernat, Anna J.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTIn recent years, 3D object detection using neural radiance fields (NeRF) has advanced significantly, yet challenges remain in effectively utilising the density field. Current methods often treat NeRF as a geometry learning tool or rely on volume rendering, neglecting the density field's potential and feature dependencies. To address this, we propose NeRF‐C3D, a novel framework incorporating a multi‐scale feature fusion module with channel attention (MFCA). MFCA leverages channel attention to model feature dependencies, dynamically adjusting channel weights during fusion to enhance important features and suppress redundancy. This optimises density field representation and improves feature discriminability. Experiments on 3D‐FRONT, Hypersim, and ScanNet demonstrate NeRF‐C3D's superior performance validating MFCA's effectiveness in capturing feature relationships and showcasing its innovation in NeRF‐based 3D detection.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The stabilization of waste sludge generated from various engineering projects to produce sludge solidified soil for use as subgrade fill is one of the effective approaches for the resource utilization of construction spoil. However, such solidified soils are typically characterized by relatively low stabilizer content and are subjected to long-term cyclic dynamic loading during their service life. In this study, typical sludge from the Ningbo region was used to prepare cement-stabilized soils with low cement content (4–7%). A series of dynamic triaxial tests under long-term cyclic loading were conducted to systematically investigate the evolution of dynamic strength, cumulative deformation, and initial dynamic elastic modulus. The test results revealed the following: (1) The cumulative deformation of the solidified soil exhibited either a “stable” or a “failure” pattern, with the transition governed by the critical dynamic load, which was strongly influenced by the cement content. (2) Increasing the cement content significantly enhanced the fatigue resistance of the solidified soil; when the content was increased from 4 to 6%, the fatigue life improved by up to 575%. (3) When the cement content exceeded 6%, the growth rates of both fatigue life and initial dynamic elastic modulus slowed markedly, indicating a clear phenomenon of diminishing marginal returns. This study identified 6–7% as the optimal economic range of cement content, achieving an optimal balance between dynamic stability and material cost. These findings provide critical design parameters and performance optimization references for the application of stabilized sludge in road engineering.",

Among them, YOLOv11x achieved the highest performance in the validation set with a precision of 0.991, recall of 0.976, mAP50 of 0.983, and mAP50–95 of 0.625, though it exhibited the longest inference delay (19 ms/img). On the external test set, YOLOv11x achieved an ear recognition accuracy of 0.996, sensitivity of 0.996, and an F1-score of 0.998. For auricular acupoint localization, the model achieved an mAP50 of 0.982, precision of 0.975, and recall of 0.976. The model has been successfully deployed as a web application, accessible on both mobile and desktop platforms to accommodate diverse user needs.ConclusionThe YoloEar21 web application, developed based on YOLOv11x and Streamlit, demonstrates superior recognition performance and user-friendly accessibility. Capable of providing automatic identification of 21 commonly used auricular acupoints across various scenarios for diverse users, it exhibits promising potential for clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "The addition of pork to beef and mutton is a potentially fraudulent practice. This study aims to detect adulteration of pork in beef and mutton using visible near-infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy. Classification models for Beef+Pork and Mutton+Pork were developed using principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). PCA demonstrated that respiratory pigments and the Soret band influenced the classification of meat based on Vis-NIR spectra. The most effective model was achieved by combining PCA with linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA), utilizing the original Vis-NIR spectra. The PCA-LDA model achieved a calibration accuracy of 99% for Beef+Pork and 82.4% for Mutton+Pork, with prediction accuracies of 91.3% and 73.7%, respectively. These results demonstrate that Vis-NIR spectroscopy can be utilized to authenticate minced meat, providing a promising approach for on-site screening or halal verification.",

    "abstract": "Background: Peritoneal metastases from gastric cancer (GCPM) represent a significant clinical challenge in terms of therapeutic options and prognosis. Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has demonstrated promising survival benefits within a multimodal approach, particularly in carefully selected patients. Methods: This retrospective single-center study evaluated outcomes in patients with synchronous GCPM treated with CRS + HIPEC following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The primary endpoints included overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and identification of prognostic factors associated with poor outcomes. Additionally, we sought to characterize patients achieving long-term survival (OS ≥ 24 months). Results: The median OS and DFS were 18 and 13 months, respectively. A peritoneal cancer index (PCI) ≥ 7 and major postoperative complications were independently associated with reduced survival. Recurrence was significantly linked to PCI ≥ 7 and signet ring cell histology. Stratification by survival outcome identified PCI ≥ 7 as the only statistically significant variable differentiating average- and long-survival groups. Moreover, elevated PCI was independently associated with a higher incidence of major postoperative complications. Conclusions: CRS + HIPEC may offer a survival advantage over the use of systemic therapy exclusively in appropriately selected patients, particularly those with limited peritoneal disease burden. These results underscore the importance of accurate patient selection to balance surgical risks and maximize oncological benefits in the treatment of GCPM.",

The reference method recommaned by the World Health Organization for assessment of anti-pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides (PCPs) IgG antibodies is a standardized serotype-specific ELISA (WHO-SSA), but this manual method is time-consuming and limit the number of evaluated PCPs. We aim to evaluate the performance values of a multiplex assay based on electrochemiluminescence (ECL-plex). A panel of 164 sera from 82 patients sampled before and 4–8 weeks after immunization by the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) were assessed by the reference WHO-SSA (7 to 13 serotypes) and by an 18-plex ECL assay (18 serotypes). All patients had normal serum Ig/subclasses levels and were classified as good (n = 43) or poor responders (n = 39, i.e. SPAD patients) according to the American Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Immunology’s (AAAAI) current guidelines. We observed excellent correlations between the two methods for anti-PCPs titers against 7 serotypes (r = 0.88 [95% CI: 0.87–0.90], n = 124 sera) and 13 serotypes (r = 0.87 [0.87–0.89], n = 40 sera). Using the AAAAI’s guidelines for interpretation, the test performance of the 18-plex ECL assay for SPAD diagnosis showed a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 84%, positive and negative predictive values of 84% and 95%, respectively. The percentage of agreement was 89% between the SSA and the 18-plex ECL assay. The 18-plex ECL assay is a reliable, rapid, and simple method for evaluating anti-PCPs response and screening for SPAD diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Some AI-based technologies entail risks that may be unacceptable for society. But how to determine what is unacceptable for society is not an easy task. This paper maps the debate surrounding bans (red lines) for AI – from early demands made by diverse stakeholders to non-binding self-regulatory instruments (AI ethics guidelines) and, finally, to the evaluation of the EU AI Act that includes prohibitions for some AI systems. It thereby points to the challenges in determining and governing AI systems with unacceptable risk primarily from a societal and political perspective. It first offers an overview of the different calls made to ban certain AI systems (or their uses). It thereby sketches the arguments brought forward against AI applications capturing the concerns and perspectives from different stakeholders. From the demands and arguments made, we deduced four major issues that are brought forward as a justification for a ban: 1) the violation of human and fundamental rights; 2) epistemic issues; 3) the violation of ethical and societal issues; 4) sectoral risks (albeit in limited form). Third, the paper analyses to what extent the many calls for bans are reflected in the EU AI Act that has finally been adopted in May 2024. The analysis demonstrates that the EU institutions have sought compromises and enacted many exemptions in the determination and regulation of prohibited AI practices and thereby the Act falls somewhat short on sufficiently accounting for the demanded bans. Consequently, there is a need for continued public debate and a subsequent refinement of the Act.",

Lysine-specific demethylase 1A (KDM1A) has been implicated in the development of various cancers, yet its specific influence on immune evasion in lung cancer and the mechanisms at play are not well defined in the current scientific discourse.  Methods: Through bioinformatics, we probed the expression patterns of KDM1A and fibrinogen-like protein 1 (FGL1) in lung cancer. continues with cellular validation. Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were utilized for the assessments of CD8+ T cell responses to tumor cells. To uncover the molecular underpinnings, we employ a suite of techniques including bioinformatics, luciferase reporter assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and qRT-PCR.  Results: Bioinformatics pointed to a positive relationship between KDM1A and FGL1, with both markers highly expressed in lung cancer. KDM1A was found to dampen the cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells towards lung cancer cells through its transcriptional activation of FGL1.  Conclusion: Our work reveals the role of KDM1A in lung cancer immune evasion by transcriptionally activating FGL1, which could inform the design of new immunotherapies.",

    "abstract": "Apple pomace, a by-product from the production of concentrated juice, is a major contributor to global food waste. Despite its beneficial nutritional profile, apple pomace is predominantly disposed of in landfills. Rapid fermentation and spoilage caused by microorganisms are compounding factors in this demise, despite significant research into upcycling strategies. Thus, there is an unmet need for economical approaches that allow for the preservation of pomace during storage and transportation to centralized processing facilities from regional hubs. To address this challenge, we investigated the potential of different preservatives for preventing microbial growth and the spoilage of apple pomace, including antimicrobials (natamycin and iodine), polysaccharides (chitosan and fucoidan), and acetic acid. Spread plates for total microbial and fungal counts were employed to assess the effectiveness of the treatments. High concentrations (10,000 ppm) of chitosan were effective at reducing the microbial load and inhibiting growth, and in combination with antimicrobials, eliminated all microbes below detectable levels. Nevertheless, acetic acid at an equivalent concentration to commercial vinegar displayed the highest economic potential. Apple pomace submerged in 0.8 M acetic acid (3 kg pomace per liter) resulted in a five-log reduction in the microbial colony-forming units (CFUs) out to 14 days and prevented fermentation and ethanol production. These results provide a foundation for the short-term storage and preservation of apple pomace that could contribute to its upcycling.",

HTH was defined as primary hypertension with homocysteine ≥15 μmol/L. Logistic regression and restricted cubic spline (RCS) models analyzed the TyG-WC index's association with HTH. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis compared TyG, WC, TyG-BMI, and TyG-WC in diagnosing HTH. An additive interaction analysis evaluated the synergistic effect of TyG and WC on HTH. Comparative analyses were conducted on the association between the TyG-WC index and both types of hypertension in the general population.Results4,012 subjects were included in this study, and the prevalence of HTH was 19.77%. After adjusting for multiple confounding factors, participants with the highest quartile of TyG-WC had a higher risk of developing HTH compared to those with the lowest quartile of TyG-WC, with OR values of 3.182 (95% CI: 2.370–4.272, P &amp;lt; 0.001). RCS analysis revealed a significant correlation between TyG-WC index and HTH (overall trend P &amp;lt; 0.001). The correlation between TyG-WC and HTH still existed in subgroup analysis. ROC curve analysis showed that TyG-WC has higher predictive value for HTH compared to other variables (AUC = 0.676, 95%CI: 0.655–0.696, P = 0.010). Interaction analysis showed an additive effect between TyG and WC, with individuals having both high TyG and high WC exhibiting a 1.66 times higher HTH risk than those with low TyG and low WC. TyG-WC demonstrated a stronger association with HTH than with general hypertension.ConclusionThe TyG-WC index has high predictive value in identifying HTH, being a promising biomarker for HTH.

We show that, upon glucose starvation caused by major fungal pathogens Candida albicans and Candida auris, macrophages lyse by activating NINJ1, the executioner of membrane rupture during cell death. In glucose-starved macrophages NINJ1 ruptures membranes independently of known cell death programs. Moreover, among cell death factors, NINJ1 is the dominant effector of fungal-induced macrophage damage. Supplementation of a single amino acid, alanine, rescues macrophages by inhibiting NINJ1 oligomerization, and C. albicans infection disrupts amino acid metabolism in mice and reduces serum alanine. Finally, NINJ1-mediated membrane rupture enables C. albicans egress from macrophage together with the toxin candidalysin. We establish the mechanism of glucose starvation-induced macrophage damage by activation of NINJ1, discover an approach to protect macrophages using a key mammalian metabolite, and demonstrate that NINJ1-dependent pathways are hijacked as an immune escape route.",

Core genome MLST analysis was conducted with Ridom Seqsphere+.\nResults\nWe observed that Illumina sequencing provided consistently high-quality reads (median Q-score 35), whereas for ONT R10.4.1, SUP mode showed higher median quality (median Q-score 15.3) compared to R9.4.1 (median Q-score 13.9, SUP mode). We observed that Illumina-based assemblies generated fewer genes annotated as disrupted; for ONT assemblies, the base-caller affects assembly annotation accuracy, with High accuracy (HAC) and Super accuracy (SUP) base-calling modes perform better than FAST mode. ONT assemblies resolved rRNA operons better than Illumina assemblies. Sequencing errors were determined by SNP calling, and varied widely by species, with ONT often generating more sequencing errors compared to Illumina. Hybrid assemblies combine accuracy and completeness effectively. Taxonomic identification and ARG detection were reliable across all methods.\nConclusion\nCombining Illumina and ONT technologies yielded optimal bacterial genome sequencing results, leveraging the high accuracy of short reads and improved contiguity of ONT long reads. The HAC and SUP ONT models with Dorado notably enhance genome assembly annotation and resolution of complex regions, although species-specific issues, likely due to repeat regions and base modifications, remain challenging even in SUP mode with Dorado. Hybrid approaches currently offer the most comprehensive and accurate genome assemblies for clinical microbiology. For reliable cgMLST even using the most recent ONT methods, resolution must be assessed on a species-by-species basis.",

    "abstract": "Reliable and accurate docking remains a fundamental challenge for autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) operating in complex industrial environments with dynamic lighting, motion blur, and occlusion. This study proposes a novel multi-sensor fusion-based docking framework that significantly enhances robustness and precision by integrating YOLOv8-based AprilTag detection, depth-aided 3D localization, and LiDAR-based orientation correction. A key contribution of this work is the construction of a custom AprilTag dataset featuring real-world visual disturbances, enabling the YOLOv8 model to achieve high-accuracy detection and ID classification under challenging conditions. To ensure precise spatial localization, 2D visual tag coordinates are fused with depth data to compute 3D positions in the robot’s frame. A LiDAR group-symmetry mechanism estimates heading deviation, which is combined with visual feedback in a hybrid PID controller to correct angular errors. A finite-state machine governs the docking sequence, including detection, approach, yaw alignment, and final engagement. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves higher docking success rates and improved pose accuracy under various challenging conditions compared to traditional vision- or LiDAR-only approaches.",

    "abstract": "In this work, a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) modified with reduced graphene oxide and β-cyclodextrin (rGO/β-CD) nanocomposite was developed for the electrochemical detection of nitrofurantoin (NFT). The structural and morphological characteristics of the synthesized nanocomposite were determined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Moreover, the electrochemical behavior of the modified electrodes was thoroughly examined using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), with the rGO/β-CD-modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) demonstrating superior electron transfer capability. Key experimental parameters, including scan rate, material loading, and solution pH, were systematically optimized. After optimizing the experimental conditions, the modified sensor showed excellent electrocatalytic performance and selectivity toward NFT, achieving a broad linear detection range from 0.5 to 120 μM, a low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.048 μM, and a high sensitivity of 12.1 µA µM–1 cm–2 using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). Furthermore, the fabricated electrode exhibited good anti-interference ability, stability, precision, and real-time applicability for NFT detection in a wastewater sample. These results highlight the potential of the rGO/β-CD nanocomposite as a high-performance platform for electrochemical sensing applications.",

    "abstract": "Background: Maternal nutrition is increasingly recognized as a modulator of offspring skeletal development. While genetics has long been considered the primary determinant of craniofacial morphology, emerging evidence suggests that prenatal and early postnatal dietary exposures also influence facial morphology. However, how maternal diet differentially affects male and female craniofacial structures remains unclear. This study aimed to examine the effects of a maternal high-fat, high-sugar (HFHS) diet on craniofacial and dental morphology in first- (F1) and second- (F2) generation adult mice. Materials and Methods: Female mice were fed a HFHS diet for six weeks before mating and throughout pregnancy and lactation. F1 offspring were weaned to a standard chow diet, and a subset of female F1 offspring were bred to produce F2 offspring, also maintained on chow. Craniofacial skeletal and dental structures of adult F1 and F2 mice at 1-year of age were assessed using micro-computed tomography for linear and geometric morphometrics. Results: HFHS diet exposure significantly reduced midfacial and mandibular length in F1 females, and these effects persisted in F2 females. Mandibular shape differences were also observed in both generations of females. In males, skull size remained unchanged, though subtle mandibular shape changes were noted in F1 only. Tooth size was reduced in both sexes of F1 offspring but not in F2. Conclusion: Maternal HFHS diet induces sex- and jaw-specific alterations in craniofacial morphology, with skeletal changes persisting in females across generations, while dental effects did not persist beyond one generation. These findings highlight the potential for maternal dietary habits to exert lasting, intergenerational influences on offspring facial form.",

    "abstract": "Downy mildew is a highly destructive fungal disease that significantly reduces both the yield and quality of kimchi cabbage. Conventional detection methods rely on manual scouting, which is labor-intensive and prone to subjectivity. This study proposes an automated detection approach using RGB imagery acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), integrated with lightweight deep learning models for leaf-level identification of downy mildew. To improve disease feature extraction, Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) segmentation was applied to the images. Among the evaluated models, Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architectures outperformed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models in terms of classification accuracy and generalization capability. For late-stage disease detection, DeiT-Tiny recorded the highest test accuracy (0.948) and macro F1-score (0.913), while MobileViT-S achieved the highest diseased recall (0.931). In early-stage detection, TinyViT-5M achieved the highest test accuracy (0.970) and macro F1-score (0.918); however, all models demonstrated reduced diseased recall under early-stage conditions, with DeiT-Tiny achieving the highest recall at 0.774. These findings underscore the challenges of identifying early symptoms using RGB imagery. Based on the classification results, prescription maps were generated to facilitate variable-rate pesticide application. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of UAV-based RGB imaging for precision agriculture, while highlighting the importance of integrating multispectral data and utilizing domain adaptation techniques to enhance early-stage disease detection.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               How did Western states move from denouncing counter-extremism as a repressive tool of authoritarian states, to adopting domestic preventing violent extremism programmes themselves? A major discursive pivot occurred in the first decade of the twenty-first century, refocusing counter-extremism work on terrorism rather than on secessionism and separatism. Counter-extremism became palatable to democratic states through de-emphasizing protest and collective action (both of which are protected in liberal democracies) as the problem of extremism, and emphasizing a radicalization process which transforms individuals into terrorists. Central to this ‘process’ is the understanding of the citizen as ‘vulnerable’ to radicalization. This chapter explores the articulation of ‘vulnerability’ as an attribution of non-rationality, requiring socio-psychological intervention. It traces the heritage of this discourse through the crime prevention working groups of the United Nations and Council of Europe. By reframing extremism as related to individual pathology, Western democracies could present socio-psychological interventions as the palatable solution.",

Optical techniques have previously observed dark excitons with a long-lived valley polarization. However, several aspects remain unknown, such as the populations and time evolution of the different valley-polarized dark excitons and the role of excitation conditions. Here, using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we obtain a holistic view of the dynamics after valley-selective photoexcitation. By varying experimental conditions, we reconcile between the rapid valley depolarization previously reported in TR-ARPES, and the observation of long-lived valley polarized dark excitons in optical studies. For the latter, we find that momentum-dark excitons largely dominate at early times sustaining a 40% degree of valley polarization, while valley-polarized spin-dark states dominate at longer times. Our measurements provide the timescales and how the different dark excitons contribute to the previously observed long-lived valley polarization in optics.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of social media and text-based communication has intensified interest in emotion detection (ED) from text. Extracting emotional content from large-scale textual sources—such as social media posts, blogs, and news articles—is both challenging and critical for various applications. This study evaluates the effectiveness of traditional machine learning algorithms in text-based emotion detection by conducting a systematic literature review (SLR), expert-based evaluation, and multiple case studies. The SLR, based on seven major digital libraries, applied a five-phase selection process to identify the most relevant studies. Findings show that Support Vector Machine (SVM) is the most frequently used and top-performing model (78% of studies), followed by Naive Bayes (60%), with customized datasets preferred in 70% of the literature. The Ekman model with six emotion classes was the most common framework, while datasets with four to eight emotion categories yielded the highest accuracy. An Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) involving 82 industry experts ranked SVM highest in accuracy, robustness, and interpretability, followed by Naive Bayes and Random Forest. Case studies further confirmed the strong performance of SVM, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes, with ensemble models improving accuracy by 3% over the best individual classifier. Additionally, the study explores transformer-based models, finding that DeBERTa outperforms traditional approaches by better capturing emotional subtleties in text. Limitations of conventional models are discussed, and practical recommendations for future improvements are provided.",

    "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been instrumental for public health laboratories in tracking severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mutations and informing responses. Illumina systems and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) have been primary tools for NGS, each presenting unique advantages. The hybrid assembly (HA) approach, integrating short- and long-read sequencing methods, has been developed to improve genome accuracy by utilizing the combined advantages of both techniques. While HA has been used to enhance SARS-CoV-2 genome quality, its optimal applications for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing and surveillance have not been systematically studied. This study seeks to address this gap by evaluating the conditions under which HA improves SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance, analysing 192 samples using eight bioinformatics methods across both platforms. HA was evaluated against single-technology approaches for its genome assembly and mutation detection performance. While HA did not outperform single-technology methods in detecting unique mutations, it produced marginally more complete genomes than Illumina-based methods. Importantly, mutations identified by HA were consistently detected across all eight methodologies, demonstrating its reliability in mutation detection. Moreover, our research underlines the critical need for in-house validation of methods and exposes the limitations inherent in proprietary pipelines. Our findings suggest that an HA approach could be used as a quality control tool in genomic surveillance, particularly for improving low-quality ONT sequencing data by integrating high-quality Illumina sequencing data. However, implementing HA demands the presence of both sequencing platforms and additional resources, such as hands-on time, expensive sequencing reagents and bioinformatics know-how. A decision-tree analysis identified the percentage of trimmed ONT reads relative to total reads as crucial for HA success, emphasizing the significance of high-quality ONT reads. This comprehensive approach provides public health laboratories insights to refine genomic surveillance strategies for SARS-CoV-2, potentially influencing future research and response efforts.",

Lake Van represents a unique environment characterized by high salinity and pH and extensive microbial communities, as revealed by SEM observation. Microbial activity, including that of cyanobacteria, can influence carbonate precipitation processes, leading to the formation of authigenic carbonates through physicochemical or metabolic mechanisms such as photosynthesis or sulfate reduction. In these environments, which are often dominated by cyanobacteria, carbonate precipitation can be influenced by biologically induced processes. This study presents new data on the hydrochemistry of lake water, focusing on the behavior of rare-earth elements (REEs) in this water and the carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions of carbonate microbial mats. The oxygen isotope data suggest that inorganic carbonate precipitation is the dominant process, but a biological influence on inorganic precipitation cannot be ruled out.

    "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Hypertension is a major contributor to cardiovascular diseases and is often intensified by psychological stress, which can also affect bone metabolism. Although both conditions independently compromise bone health, their combined impact—particularly under acute and chronic stress—remains unclear. This pilot study aimed to assess the effects of such stressors on bone structure in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Methods: Forty male rats, both normotensive and SHRs, were randomly assigned to control, acute stress, or chronic stress groups. Acute stress involves a single 2 h physical restraint. Chronic stress was induced over 10 days using alternating stressors: agitation, forced swimming, physical restraint, cold exposure, and water deprivation. Tibial bones were analyzed by microcomputed tomography (micro-CT), and histology was performed using Hematoxylin and Eosin and Masson’s Trichrome stains. Results: Micro-CT showed increased trabecular bone volume in normotensive rats under chronic stress, whereas SHRs displayed impaired remodeling under both stress types. Histological analysis revealed preserved connective tissue overall but evident changes in growth plate structure among stressed rats. SHRs exhibited exacerbated trabecular formation and cartilage abnormalities, including necrotic zones. Conclusions: Both acute and chronic stress, especially in the context of hypertension, negatively affect bone remodeling and maturation. Despite the absence of overt inflammation, structural bone changes were evident, indicating potential long-term risks. These findings highlight the importance of further studies on stress–hypertension interactions in bone health as well as the exploration of therapeutic approaches to mitigate skeletal damage under such conditions.",

In early-stage disease, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) comprises ∼0.05% of the total cfDNA, with the remainder originating from hematopoietic and other non-malignant tissues, significantly limiting detection sensitivity. Filtering non-tumor fragments can improve tumor-specific signal, but distinguishing ctDNA from non-tumor methylation patterns remains challenging due to biological overlap and technical noise. Generative models, particularly denoising diffusion models (DDMs), are well-suited for cfDNA analysis due to their capacity to model complex data distributions perturbed by structured and stochastic noise. Building on this, we developed a novel approach that adapts DDMs to learn non-cancer cfDNA methylation patterns and filter fragment-level data, thereby enhancing tumor-derived signal and TOO inference. Peripheral blood samples (CORE-HH study; NCT05435066) were collected in 9 cancer types from treatment-naïve cancer patients (N=401) and individuals with no reported cancer, evenly distributed across ages (N=100). cfDNA was extracted from plasma and profiled using a custom 18.6 Mb targeted bisulfite sequencing hybrid capture assay. cfDNA fragments were pre-processed to retain only CpG sites, with methylation states encoded as binary sequences. U-Net based Denoising Diffusion Implicit models (DDIMs) were trained on these sequences to learn the underlying methylation patterns in non-cancer cfDNA (N=80). Mean Squared Error was used as reconstruction error to identify and retain tumor derived cfDNA fragments. Tumor-derived fragments, being out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the training data, exhibit higher errors than non-cancer fragments, allowing for their effective identification. OOD thresholds per genomic start location were established from cfDNA fragments in held-out non-cancer samples (N=20). To predict TOO across all cancer samples, we trained a four-layer feed-forward neural network using five distinct metrics that quantify informative methylation signals at each genomic region of interest (Farashahi et al. (2024), Clin Cancer Res, 30). Performance was evaluated using 10-fold cross validation and reported for samples with tumor fraction greater than 0.1% (N=227). Filtering the samples using 90th percentile OOD thresholds revealed a significant correlation (Kendall’s τ=0.5) between the estimated tumor fraction of samples and the fraction of retained reads. Keeping only these reads increased the estimated tumor fraction ten-fold. Our TOO multi-class classification on filtered cfDNA achieved 87% balanced accuracy (BA) versus 78% BA on unfiltered cfDNA. These findings demonstrate that denoising-based OOD models can effectively learn non-tumor cfDNA methylation patterns despite inherent noise in cfDNA and filter fragment-level data to enhance tumor-derived signal. This novel approach improves TOO resolution and can increase the clinical utility of multi-cancer early detection by guiding diagnostic workup.\n               \n               \n                  Citation Format:\n                  Shiva Farashahi, Yifan Wu, Elie Massaad, Feras Hantash, Hutan Ashrafian, Dorna Kashef, Kieran Chacko.

    "abstract": "Abstract\n        The inactivation of pathogens using ultraviolet (UV) radiation has become a critical research focus following the COVID-19 pandemic, underscoring the need for advanced decontamination strategies against viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens. This study proposes the use of short pulses of UV-C radiation (220–280 nm) as an effective method for pathogen inactivation. Our primary objective is to evaluate the decontamination efficacy of pulsed UV-C radiation by varying the time intervals between pulses while maintaining constant pulse energy, and to analyze the resulting absorption spectra of a yeast solution across different irradiation durations. The research addresses two main components: (1) a theoretical model examining the effects of short UV-C pulses on biomolecules during radiation propagation, and (2) practical applications for pathogen diagnosis, treatment, and inactivation, with significant implications for ontogenetic and public health outcomes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBloodstream infection (BSI) exhibits elevated mortality, particularly among elderly patients manifesting atypical symptoms. Although blood culture (BC) remains the diagnostic gold standard, its limited sensitivity and prolonged turnaround time impede early detection. Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR), a novel pathogen detection method with superior sensitivity and rapid results, demonstrates significant diagnostic and prognostic for BSI. However, heightened sensitivity may increase false positive rates, with elderly patients particularly susceptible to specimen contamination and transient bacteremia.MethodsThis retrospective study employed clinical judgment as the diagnostic reference. Patients were stratified into BSI and non-BSI groups, with data collected on ddPCR and BC results, imaging and laboratory findings, medication response, and discharge outcomes. The diagnostic accuracy and antibiotic guidance efficacy of ddPCR and BC were compared, and the clinical utility of ddPCR was evaluated for prognostic assessment and false positive identification.ResultsThe analysis encompassed 355 episodes from 280 elderly patients with suspected BSI. ddPCR demonstrated significantly higher detection rates compared to BC in BSI group (59.33% versus 20.57%). Combined implementation increased detection to 65.07%. Regardless of clinical judgment (59.61% versus 20.57%) or alternative microbiological tests (90.63% versus 7.14%) served as the reference standards, ddPCR exhibited superior sensitivity to BC. No significant differences emerged in antibiotic adjustment rates or therapeutic efficacy between ddPCR and BC. Elevated microbial species diversity correlated with unfavorable discharge outcomes (P&amp;lt;0.001, OR=2.122). Multiple follow-up ddPCR monitoring revealed progressive increases in the number of species and the copies of some (or all) species among patients with poor outcomes, contrasting with decreasing trends in those with favorable outcomes. When detecting Streptococcus, coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS), Acinetobacter baumannii complex, and Candida, diagnostic thresholds of 132.55, 182.70/262.24, and 174.78 copies/mL, respectively, were established to help differentiate false-positive results.ConclusionThe combination of ddPCR with BC improves BSI diagnosis in elderly patients and facilitates antibiotic treatment optimization. Moreover, ddPCR demonstrates potential for prognostic evaluation and false-positive discrimination. Nevertheless, these findings require further validation through large-scale prospective studies employing predefined clinical criteria.",

By employing qualitative exploratory research and utilizing the method of legal dogmatics within Mexico's legislative framework, the historical development of the right to health is explained from a hermeneutic perspective, supported by doctrinal insights and jurisprudence from the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation on the matter, and comparing these findings to the current situation regarding the protection of the right to health. The research employed a documentary technique, gathering information from books and articles of legal relevance related to human rights and the healthcare system in Mexico. The investigation demonstrated that, in the context of a healthcare crisis and a scarcity of oncological medications, the fundamental rights of children with cancer are frequently and systematically violated. Furthermore, the General Law for Early Detection of Cancer in Childhood and Adolescence serves as an indication of an ambitious response to the nation's requirements in the realms of public health and human rights. In this context, it is crucial to enact this law to prioritize childhood cancer management, reduce mortality rates, and ensure access to treatments, providing a tangible source of hope for those affected.",

    "abstract": "Target detection in UAV aerial images has found increasingly widespread applications in emergency rescue, maritime monitoring, and environmental surveillance. However, traditional detection models suffer significant performance degradation due to challenges including substantial scale variations, high proportions of small targets, and dense occlusions in UAV-captured images. To address these issues, this paper proposes DMF-YOLO, a high-precision detection network based on YOLOv10 improvements. First, we design Dynamic Dilated Snake Convolution (DDSConv) to adaptively adjust the receptive field and dilation rate of convolution kernels, enhancing local feature extraction for small targets with weak textures. Second, we construct a Multi-scale Feature Aggregation Module (MFAM) that integrates dual-branch spatial attention mechanisms to achieve efficient cross-layer feature fusion, mitigating information conflicts between shallow details and deep semantics. Finally, we propose an Expanded Window-based Bounding Box Regression Loss Function (EW-BBRLF), which optimizes localization accuracy through dynamic auxiliary bounding boxes, effectively reducing missed detections of small targets. Experiments on the VisDrone2019 and HIT-UAV datasets demonstrate that DMF-YOLOv10 achieves 50.1% and 81.4% mAP50, respectively, significantly outperforming the baseline YOLOv10s by 27.1% and 2.6%, with parameter increases limited to 24.4% and 11.9%. The method exhibits superior robustness in dense scenarios, complex backgrounds, and long-range target detection. This approach provides an efficient solution for UAV real-time perception tasks and offers novel insights for multi-scale object detection algorithm design.",

    "abstract": "Pollutants and pathogens in aquaculture systems may cause economic losses and threaten public health. Yet, the risks associated with microbiological contaminants and their relationship with environmental factors remain largely unknown. In this study, two typical eel farms in southeast China were chosen for investigation of water quality and microbial community in the treatment processes. It was found that flocculant addition can only effectively reduce total phosphorus (TP) in both farms. However, excessive total nitrogen (TN) was found (6.16 mg/L and 6.74 mg/L, respectively). NH4+ (3.98 mg/L) was the main nitrogen pollutant in QR farm, while NO3− (3.81 mg/L) and NO2− (1.22 mg/L) were the main nitrogen pollutants in ZJ farm. The treatment processes could not effectively remove nitrogen pollution, and the abundance of nitrogen functional bacteria was low. NO2− was positively correlated with Verrucomicrobiota (p &lt; 0.05). NH4+ and TN were significantly negatively correlated with Nitrospirota and unclassified_f_Anaerolineaceae, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). Some typical pathogens associated with aquaculture (e.g., Lactococcus) and human beings (e.g., Escherichia-Shigella,) were found in the systems. This study proposes suggestions for aquaculture tailwater by analyzing the shortcomings of the existing treatment processes. Meanwhile, it offers certain support for the prevention of pathogen risks in aquaculture systems.",

The characteristic narrow mass distributions of viruses, together with the existing correlations between their stiffness and infectivity, point out to nanomechanical sensors as a particularly suited alternative to molecular detection techniques, constrained by limited processing speed, target-specificity, and the inability to directly assess infectivity. We present a theoretical analysis of the response of flexural beam resonators to the adsorption of nanoparticulate analytes, and derive analytical expressions for the mass and stiffness sensing responsivity, resolution and signal to noise ratio as a function of the beam characteristics and analyte adsorption parameters. We demonstrate that both the mass and stiffness of viruses can contribute to resonance frequency shifts that significantly exceed the fundamental detection limits of beams with plausible dimensions and for realistic adsorption parameters. Particularly, stiffness resolution can reach levels well below the stiffness variations observed in some viruses as a consequence of maturation, enabling an integrated approach for infectivity assessment. We conclude that the practical application of nanomechanical spectrometry for infectious virus detection is not limited by the performance of state-of-the-art sensor technology, but by the efficiency of analyte delivery methods, encouraging future research on optimizing their implementation.",

    "abstract": "Mine ventilation systems are critical for ensuring operational safety, yet air leakage remains a pervasive challenge, leading to energy inefficiency and heightened safety risks. Traditional tracer gas methods, while effective in simple networks, exhibit significant errors in complex multi-entry systems due to static empirical parameters and environmental interference. This study proposes an integrated methodology that combines multi-path airflow analysis with dynamic longitudinal dispersion coefficient correction to enhance the accuracy of air leakage detection. Utilizing sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) as the tracer gas, a phased release protocol with temporal isolation was implemented across five strategic points in a coal mine ventilation network. High-precision detectors (Bruel &amp; Kiaer 1302) and the MIVENA system enabled synchronized data acquisition and 3D network modeling. Theoretical models were dynamically calibrated using field-measured airflow velocities and dispersion coefficients. The results revealed three deviation patterns between simulated and measured tracer peaks: Class A deviation showed 98.5% alignment in single-path scenarios, Class B deviation highlighted localized velocity anomalies from Venturi effects, and Class C deviation identified recirculation vortices due to abrupt cross-sectional changes. Simulation accuracy improved from 70% to over 95% after introducing wind speed and dispersion adjustment coefficients, resolving concealed leakage pathways between critical nodes and key nodes. The study demonstrates that the dynamic correction of dispersion coefficients and multi-path decomposition effectively mitigates errors caused by turbulence and geometric irregularities. This approach provides a robust framework for optimizing ventilation systems, reducing invalid airflow losses, and advancing intelligent ventilation management through real-time monitoring integration.",

To reduce the cost of sensors and improve or maintain e-nose’s performance, efficient optimization of sensor arrays is required. For this issue, we proposed a new sensor array optimization algorithm named Interfered Feature Elimination coupled with Feature Group Selection (IFE-FGS). In this method, the IFE algorithm first removed the bad sensor features; then the FGS algorithm determined the optimized sensor combination by gradually selecting the features in groups. The experimental results show the superiority of the IFE- FGS method on two bacteria datasets and six public gene expression profiling datasets. IFE- FGS achieves the classification accuracy of 93.95% and 94.94% in mean accuracy and max accuracy, respectively, on the bacteria dataset 2, which is significantly ahead of the comparison methods. Besides, our proposed method shows consistency and effectiveness. It achieves excellent performance, which takes two first-places, four second-places in mean accuracy, one first-place, and six second-places in max accuracy. Moreover, it also explores three novel and valuable discoveries for the electronic nose: 1) It can effectively identify biomarkers in the application. 2) It can effectively distinguish the degree of chemical components contributing to odors. 3) It can reveal the effective detection range of the targets.",

This study enhances the long-term water stability of tuff asphalt mixtures by incorporating cement and anti-stripping agents, evaluating their performance under prolonged water exposure. A fractional grey prediction model (FGM) was employed to predict long-term behavior, while a comprehensive evaluation framework was developed using weighted averaging and relative scoring methods. Results demonstrate that both additives significantly improve water stability. Water damage leads to an increase in the viscous components and a decrease in the elastic recovery capacity of asphalt mixtures, which directly results in a decline in their high-temperature rutting resistance. The FGM exhibits high accuracy, with prediction errors below 3% compared to experimental data.

This study utilizes sequence analysis to describe the ordering and timing of cardiometabolic disease accumulation over a five-year period and to assess both sociodemographic predictors and cognitive outcomes of typical cardiometabolic disease sequences.\n\n\nMethods\nWe analyzed data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study (2011–2022), including respondents aged ≥65 years without CMM or cognitive impairment at baseline (N = 4956). We used sequence analysis with optimal matching and hierarchical cluster analysis to describe temporal patterns of cardiometabolic disease accumulation and to construct a typology by clustering similar sequences. Sociodemographic predictors of CMM cluster membership were assessed using multinomial logistic regression and discrete time survival analysis was used to examine the association of CMM clusters with subsequent dementia development.\n\n\nResults\n11.8% of respondents developed CMM within 5-years. From a total of 366 distinct cardiometabolic disease sequences, we identified eight cardiometabolic sequence clusters. The first five clusters, “No Cardiometabolic Disease” (N = 2283, 46.1%); “Diabetes Only” (N=642, 13.0%); Heart Disease Only” (N = 297, 6.0%); “MI Only” (N = 145, 2.9%); “Stroke Only” (N = 132, 2.7%), were composed of persons who did not develop CMM over the observation period. The sixth cluster, “Incident CVD with Multimorbidity” (N = 656, 13.2%), was largely composed of persons with no conditions at baseline who developed incident cardiometabolic disease and/or CMM during the observation period (N = 477, 72.7%) and the seventh cluster, “Diabetes Multimorbidity” (N = 333, 6.7%), primarily consisted of persons with diabetes who developed incident CMM. Finally, the eight cluster (N = 468, 9.4%) was characterized by mortality early in the observation period with minimal CMM development during the observation period. Black and Hispanic race/ethnicity, lower wealth, and obesity were associated with increased likelihood of membership in one or both of the clusters characterized by CMM development. We observed increased dementia risk among persons in the Incident CVD with Multimorbidity cluster (HR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.04–1.67) and the Diabetes MM cluster (HR = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.44,2.44).\n\n\nConclusions\nDevelopment of cardiometabolic multimorbidity is more likely among minoritized and/or low-income older adults and is associated with increased risk of subsequent dementia. Targeted approaches to cardiometabolic disease prevention and risk reduction may be an effective means of slowing or preventing the onset of cognitive decline among these groups.",

    "abstract": "The widespread adoption of cyber–physical–social systems (CPSSs) in the power industry has necessitated power marketing inspection as a critical component for ensuring secure and reliable operations of power systems. However, this effort entails significant challenges resulting from the massive volume of inspection data and complexity of electricity usage scenarios. Traditional inspection methods often fail to identify potential risks and abnormal behaviors effectively; to address this, we propose an intelligent security identification model for CPSS-based power marketing inspection by integrating advanced artificial intelligence techniques to enhance security defense and risk management. The proposed model incorporates a work order correlation matching algorithm, a fault interval detection algorithm, an electricity consumption prediction algorithm, and a business anomaly identification algorithm. Here, the users are first categorized based on multisource data to detect abnormal electricity usage precisely. Then, the model employs a correlation algorithm to uncover the intrinsic links between fault handling and electricity refund work orders for the same user, thereby revealing potential security vulnerabilities. Subsequently, the fault interval detection algorithm is used to locate fault periods, and the electricity consumed within these intervals is dynamically estimated using a prediction algorithm. Finally, an intelligent classification model based on recurrent neural networks and long short-term memory networks is developed by leveraging key security features to identify abnormal business behaviors accurately. Experiments were then conducted on three publicly available power industry datasets, and the results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1-score for security event detection. The proposed approach effectively enhances the safety and reliability of power marketing inspection for CPSSs while offering a novel technical framework for power system protection and privacy preservation.",

Most of the markers exhibited high levels of cross-species transferability, successfully amplifying in related species such as Annona cherimola (94.2%), Annona reticulata (95.7%), Annona glabra (97.1%), Annona muricata (90%) and Annona atemoya (80%). The results of this study demonstrate that species-specific genomic simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are more accurate for assessing genetic diversity. The SSR markers developed in this study will be valuable for diversity analysis, species identification, linkage map construction, DNA fingerprinting and crop improvement.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n        During a lightning strike, various mechanical loadings induced by lightning arc contribute to the degradation and failure of composites. So far, numerical research has mainly concentrated on modeling the resistive heating with or without consideration of certain thermal induced mechanical effects. This paper aims to develop a fully coupled thermal-chemical-mechanical finite element model to investigate the lightning-induced dynamic response and mechanical damage in carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminate under coupled effects of thermal ablation and comprehensive loadings from acoustic pressure, electromagnetic force and thermal expansion. The FE prediction is successfully validated with preceding experimental and numerical results available in the literature. The results quantify the potential contribution of mechanical loadings resulting from acoustic pressure, electromagnetic force and thermal expansion on dynamic response and damage.The predicted dynamic response shows that the acoustic pressure and thermal expansion occupy the main contribution to negative deflection at both sides of laminate whereas in the central region of laminate, the thermal expansion plays a leading role in the generation of positive deflection. The impact of mechanical loadings on in-plane damage of laminate is stronger than in-depth damage which however, is dominated by thermal ablation effect with its contribution of 86%. The predicted damage under various mechanical loadings suggests the consideration of thermal expansion makes a remarkable increment in matrix and delamination damage areas with their corresponding contribution of 104% and 108% whereas the presence of acoustic pressure and electromagnetic force tends to weaken these damages.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n        Accurate and robust fault diagnosis of rotary machines is essential for maintaining the safety and reliability of industrial systems. Although deep learning methods have achieved remarkable success in this domain, their performance tends to decline in the presence of noise. In this study, a functional deep learning framework is introduced, in which raw vibration signals are transformed into smooth functional representations prior to being processed by deep learning architectures. By incorporating functional data analysis (FDA), the noise robustness and generalization ability of standard models are enhanced. Functional adaptations of several well-established one-dimensional convolutional networks are implemented and evaluated on a benchmark dataset under varying signalto-noise ratios (SNRs). The experimental results demonstrate that functional representations consistently improve diagnostic accuracy, particularly in lowSNR environments. These findings underscore the effectiveness of functional techniques in enhancing deep learning-based fault diagnosis of rotary machines operating under noisy conditions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Routine analytical techniques for assessing lipid oxidation frequently require expensive, complex equipment or intricate procedures, which restrict their use in day-to-day situations. Also, ordinary consumers could not follow up on the deterioration of household edible oils as they lack proficiency. An effective way to determine the freshness of edible oil is to look for a visual detection procedure. Aldehydes, which are significant chemicals created during the oxidation of lipids, could be employed to follow up on oil deterioration during storage. Here, a colorimetric composite sensor for aldehydes made of polyvinyl alcohol and sodium alginate was created and used to visually detect the oxidation of edible oil. Congo red and either hydroxylamine sulfate or hydroxylamine chloride were used to manufacture the sensor. The unique reaction between hydroxylamine sulfate or hydroxylamine chloride and aldehydes releases mineral acid and lowers pH, causing Congo’s color to change from red to blue, an easy visual way to detect the aging of stored oils. The response of the hydroxylamine sulfate sensor film was more pronounced visually than that of hydroxylamine chloride. Additionally, the relationship between the sensor films’ efficacy and the concentration of hexanal or peroxide value was examined. The sensor films strongly correlated to the two major oil oxidation markers, namely, hexanal and PV of both soybean and olive oils, indicating the reliability of the colorimetric sensor with considerable potential for visual detection of edible oil oxidation.",

    "abstract": "An orthotropic steel deck is a type of slab that has the function of directly supporting trucks on bridges. Since orthotropic steel decks are constructed by welding together thin steel plates, numerous fatigue cracks have occurred on routes with heavy truck traffic. In particular, cracking at the rib-to-deck welds in orthotropic steel decks poses one of the most serious problems. Cracks in the rib-to-deck welds cannot be detected by visual inspection and can be investigated most effectively by ultrasonic testing. The main issues with conventional manual testing are that it takes a lot of time to detect the cracks and that skilled engineers are required. This paper introduces a newly developed cutting-edge ultrasonic imaging method and its application to inspect deck plate fatigue cracks and bead fatigue crack of orthotropic steel deck bridges. The inspection system presented here involves advanced high-speed ultrasonic inspection equipment that incorporates parallel processing circuitry for image synthesis and a remotely operated four-wheel scanner with an ultrasonic array probe for angle beam inspection. The system is capable of synthesizing 3D images of the crack propagation and its shape with high resolution along the weld line, in real time, by integrating the B-scope images taken after each 2 mm of scanner movement. Through verification testing of fatigue crack propagation test specimens, it was confirmed that this inspection system gives improvements of inspection performance by achieving better crack shape visualization and a higher measurement accuracy of ±0.8 mm at a depth of 1.3 mm or more for a deck plate crack and ±1.0 mm at a depth of 1.9 mm or more for a bead crack compared to traditional inspection methods. Verification tests are currently being conducted on actual bridges, with a practical application planned for the near future.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOphioglossum vulgatum L. is a widely utilized medicinal plant, with the entire plant being used for medicinal purposes. This study systematically characterized the endophytic and rhizospheric community structure, taxonomic diversity, and symbiotic networks within distinct compartments of O. vulgatum, while evaluating their potential associations with the accumulation of pharmacologically active metabolites.MethodsEndophytic and rhizospheric community profiling was conducted via Illumina sequencing, while bioactive compounds were identified using UPLC-ESI-MS/MS.ResultsRoots and leaves harbored beneficial bacteria (e.g., Methylobacterium, Streptomyces, Sphingomonas, and Flavobacterium). Dominant fungi included Archaeorhizomyces (rhizosphere soil) and Homophron (roots/leaves). Dark septate endophytes (DSEs; e.g., Cladosporium, Cladophialophora, and Chaetomium) were abundant across rhizosphere soil, roots, and leaves. Alpha/beta diversity analyses showed higher microbial richness in rhizosphere soil than in plant tissues. Functional predictions (PICRUSt2/FUNGuild) linked endophytic and rhizospheric bacteria to metabolism, human diseases, and biological systems. Network analysis highlighted Basidiomycota as keystone taxa, with modular community structure. Functional predictions revealed that endophytic and rhizospheric microorganisms were associated with critical metabolic pathways, particularly in the biosynthesis of flavonoids and alkaloids (primary bioactive compounds). LEFSe analyses highlighted compartment-specific biomarkers: Acidobacteria, Basidiomycota, and Ascomycota were enriched in distinct zones (rhizosphere, roots, and leaves), with Actinobacteria exhibiting highly significant correlations (P &amp;lt; 0.01) with flavonoids, lipids, and quinones, while Acidobacteria, Basidiomycota, and Ascomycota were strongly linked to steroids and tannins (P &amp;lt; 0.05).ConclusionThe diversity and abundance of microbial communities in O. vulgatum exhibited tissue-specific and rhizosphere-dependent variations, with distinct patterns strongly correlating to bioactive compound accumulation. Notably, biomarker taxa including Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Basidiomycota, and Ascomycota demonstrated robust microbe–metabolite interactions, suggesting their critical regulatory role in biosynthesis pathways. These findings establish endophytic-rhizospheric microbiota as key biosynthetic modulators, proposing innovative approaches for enhancing phytochemical production through targeted microbial community manipulation.",

We aimed to assess safety and efficacy of ZF catheter ablation in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs), examine learning-curve characteristics and to evaluate long-term results and mortality.MethodsWe analysed clinical characteristics, procedural and follow-up data of 605 consecutive patients undergoing catheter ablation for SVT (atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia, n = 297; atrial flutter, n = 241 and accessory pathway mediated tachycardia, n = 67) between June 2017 and September 2021. Procedures were either guided by conventional fluoroscopy (F, n = 223) or by EnSite Precision mapping system (ZF, n = 382) based on decision of the operating physician.ResultsAcute procedural success rate exceeded 98% across all arrhythmia groups for both ZF and F techniques (ZF: 99%, F: 100%, p = NS). 63% of patients underwent ZF procedures. Complication rate was low (0.66%), occurring only in the F group. Conversion rate to fluoroscopy was 7.8%. ZF procedures took an average of 5.1 min longer (ZF: 64.5 ± 24.3 min vs. F: 59.4 ± 29 min, p &amp;lt; 0.05), however ZF procedure times were reduced over time.

This study aimed to examine whether guideline adherence, assessed using the individual fitness score (IFS), correlated with actigraphy‐measured sleep in long‐term hospitalized patients.MethodsWe included 40 inpatients aged &lt;65 years who were diagnosed with schizophrenia. Guideline adherence was assessed using the IFS and actigraphy was used to measure total sleep time (TST), sleep latency (SL), and sleep efficiency (SE). In 33 patients, these measures were re‐evaluated after 6 months.ResultsCross‐sectional analysis showed a positive correlation between IFS and TST (rho = 0.362, P = 0.022), which persisted after adjusting for Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores (β = 0.318, P = 0.024). IFS was not associated with SL or SE, and differences in hypnotic use did not significantly affect the sleep parameters. Additionally, longitudinal changes in IFS over 6 months were not significantly associated with changes in TST, SL, or SE (all P &gt; 0.05).ConclusionIn this cohort of long‐term hospitalized patients with schizophrenia, guideline adherence (higher IFS) was associated with increased TST. However, no clear longitudinal effects of IFS on sleep were observed. These findings emphasize the importance of guideline adherence in optimizing sleep, although extended follow‐ups and larger sample sizes are required to confirm the long‐term impact of guideline‐based treatments on sleep in patients with schizophrenia.",

The tapered optical fiber, fabricated by the flame-brushing technique, has a waist diameter of approximately 3.5 µm, where gold nanoparticles with a size of 100 nm were deposited through photodeposition using a continuous-wave 1535 nm laser. Detection was performed for hCG hormone solutions prepared in tri-distilled water and human urine, covering a concentration range from 1 mIU ml−1 to 180 mIU ml−1, which is clinically relevant for cancer detection. The biosensor showed a spectral shift in output wavelength and a variation in output optical power as a function of hCG hormone concentration, enabling a quantifiable, reproducible, and specific detection. The limits of detection were 0.04 mIU ml−1 for the solution in tri-distilled water and 0.03 mIU ml−1 for the solution in urine, with sensitivity of 0.012 nm (mIU ml−1)−1 and 0.021 nm (mIU ml−1)−1, respectively. The proposed biosensor is capable of specifically detecting the hCG hormone at different levels of concentration without the use of antigens as bioreceptors. These results demonstrate the potential of optical fiber non functionalized biosensors decorated with metallic nanoparticles for developing highly sensitive biosensors with biomedical applications, opening new possibilities for the early diagnosis of diseases associated with abnormal expression of the hCG hormone.",

This method reduces the number of printed layers, thus lowering the overall time and cost of production. The optical contrast and visual homogeneity of the indicators can be tuned by modifying the electropolymerization voltage and limiting the charge. Due to the opaque nature of the printed electrolyte, the switching speed can be increased, and the operating voltage can be lowered by electropolymerizing an electrochromic film onto the counter electrode to act as a charge storage material. The best performing indicators exhibit a contrast of 31.1%R (600 nm), with a 1 s switching speed. The CIELAB color co-ordinates of the indicators were measured over 100 k cycles. During this period, the indicators showed an overall increase in contrast. The long cycling lifetime of the indicators makes them promising candidates for applications where frequent switching is required.",

As a result of interaction the characteristic peak of ssDNA, due to the oxidation of guanine residues, decreased. The interaction behaviour between leucine and ssDNA was studied with UV-vis spectrophotometry, the obtained results are in good agreement. The results of the interaction study were exploited in order to develop a SWV method for the determination of leucine at the ssDNA modified carbon paste electrode (CPE). Different parameters were tested to optimize the conditions of the determination.  The peak of guanine was at around +0.86 V. Linearity was observed in the range of  1,4.10-9 - 3,5.10-8  mol/L( r= 0,9990 ) while LOD  equals 4,9.10-10 mol/L. The method was applied in spiked soil sample and gave satisfactory results.",

The engine integrates a parallel four-channel dual-polarization coherent detection module, an on-chip optical splitting system, a laser nonlinearity calibration module utilizing a large-scale optical delay line (DL), and an on-chip local light optical splitting unit on a single chip. Key components, including germanium-silicon photodetectors, were optimized to achieve high responsivity (1.09 A/W) and low dark current (3.6 nA). The on-chip delay line design achieves an optical time delay of 5.74 ns with improved loss, enabling nonlinearity calibration that enhances signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spectrum linewidth. The packaged silicon photonic engine, with a chip size of 2.8 mm × 2.7 mm, demonstrates ranging capabilities up to 200 m with SNR exceeding 10 dB across all four channels. This study represents a new integration solution for the FMCW laser ranging system, providing a robust platform for automotive and other high-precision ranging applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Beta oscillations (±13–35 Hz) and aperiodic spectral features extracted from local field potential (LFP) recordings have been identified as promising physiomarkers for adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) in Parkinson’s disease. However, the long-term consistency of these signal features across behavioural and clinical conditions remains unclear. Bilateral subthalamic nucleus LFPs were recorded from twelve patients with an average inter-recording interval of 137 days, during rest, a finger-to-nose task and speech, with stimulation switched off and on. Intra-class correlation coefficients indicated moderate between-visit consistency for aperiodic offset and exponent but good to excellent consistency of beta peak power. Most aperiodic and power changes induced by task execution and stimulation were statistically comparable across visits. Results remained inconclusive regarding the properties of beta peaks exhibiting the strongest power suppression post-stimulation. Our findings support the potential of beta peak power as primary physiomarker for aDBS, with aperiodic components as possibly suitable supplementary markers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               The increase of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in breath after cannabis inhalation has been well-documented in the forensic field, but the trends after ingestion of cannabis-infused edibles have not yet been investigated. In this study, participants ingested a cannabis-infused edible and provided breath samples before and at three timepoints after ingestion. Participants were assigned to one of two breath sampling devices. THC was found in most pre-use breath samples and THC concentration had variable trends after ingestion. Nineteen participants exhibited a maximum in their THC concentration at 47 min, 92 min, or 180 min after ingestion, while six participants had their highest THC concentration before the observed ingestion and four participants had no significant change in THC concentration over the four samples. Five additional cannabinoids were detected in breath. While cannabidiol (CBD) trends followed THC trends for some participants, diverging trends in other participants suggest different biological processing of CBD derived from edibles. This proof-of-concept study shows that THC concentration in breath can increase after the ingestion of cannabis-infused edibles, but the uncertainty of breath measurements and a longer time window need to be further explored.",

    "abstract": "This study used systematic coring, hyperspectral scans, carbonate/siliciclastic analysis, and stable isotope measurements to evaluate environmental controls on large microbial buildup evolution. Buildups initiated on a discontinuous transgressive lag of flat-pebble conglomerate, controlling their spatial distribution and flat-based geometry. The consistent three-phase buildup architecture indicates allogenic forcing by fluctuations in sea level and siliciclastic influx. The initiation of each phase began in a pure carbonate system, with high-energy skeletal-oolitic grainstone interbuildup deposition. Depositional moats formed in the grainstone adjacent to buildups during phases 1 and 2. Buildups developed up to 5.7 m of synoptic relief during phases 1 and 3 prior to being onlapped by siliciclastic sediment. Phase 2 of the buildups intertongued with heterolithic interbuildup sediment, developing only 30 cm of synoptic relief. Lateral variability in phase 2 architecture indicates autogenic controls causing localized differences in microbialite growth rates versus interbuildup accumulation. Phases 1 and 3 display a dense calcitic calcimicrobial rind that surrounds and encloses the top of the buildups. The interior of buildups is composed of decimeter-scale stromatolitic columns, each encased by a calcimicrite rind and exhibiting mottled internal texture due to bioturbation and dolomitization. Interiors of buildups entrapped more carbonate sediment, creating greater porosity, and thus were destructively dolomitized. In contrast, the calcimicrite rinds of columns and the thick rinds surrounding buildups formed as biochemical carbonate precipitates, with minimal porosity, and, therefore, escaped dolomitization. The δ18O and δ13C values of the column and buildup rinds are consistent with late Cambrian seawater, supporting an origin as a precipitate and age as Sunwaptan.",

    "abstract": "Industrial Control Systems (ICS), including Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and Distributed Control Systems (DCS), are increasingly becoming targets of sophisticated cyber threats. This heightened vulnerability is primarily driven by the convergence of Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT), as well as the rapid adoption of Industry 4. 4.0 technologies. Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) often fall short in addressing the unique characteristics of ICS environments, which include strict real- time operational constraints, the use of legacy systems, and the presence of heterogeneous data sources.To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a novel multimodal deep learning framework for robust anomaly detection in ICS networks. The proposed model integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short- Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Autoencoders to effectively capture spatial, temporal, and nonlinear features from ICS traffic. The framework is trained and evaluated using the HAI Security Dataset, a realistic ICS dataset that includes various attack scenarios. The hybrid model demonstrates strong performance, achieving an accuracy of 92%, an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0. 97, and a perfect recall score in detecting cyberattacks, indicating its potential effectiveness in real- world applications.To improve the transparency and trustworthiness of the detection outcomes, the framework incorporates explainable AI (XAI) techniques, including SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model- agnostic Explanations). These tools provide insights into model decisions and help operators understand the reasoning behind anomaly classifications. The paper discusses practical deployment challenges such as scalability, latency, and integration with existing ICS architectures. It also explores promising future research directions, including the application of federated learning for decentralized data privacy, digital twin technology for dynamic system modeling, and the development of resilient models tailored for real-time industrial cybersecurity operations.",

    "authors": "Jonne Harmsma",
    "issuedDate": "2025-7-10",
    "abstract": "The politicization of the environment in the 1970s involved a paradigmatic challenge to the ‘hegemony of growth’. In the Netherlands, this economic growth debate was particularly fierce and long-lasting, with protagonists among left-wing parties, Christian democrats, and right-wing liberals, all advocating some sort of ‘limits to growth’. Moreover, the Dutch growth debate also took on a policymaking dimension. Propelled by earlier attempts to implement ‘selectivity’ in certain policies, the Selective Growth Memorandum of 1976 set out to surpass the hegemony of growth and align environmental and economic objectives. As such, the Dutch growth debate of the early 1970s inspired a rapprochement in which environmental regulation was framed as a positive-sum game in consonance with economic considerations by stimulating investments, productivity, and growth. Even though the memorandum ultimately ended up primarily re-articulating the growth paradigm, this article highlights that discursively, it still prefigured the discourse of ecological modernization that would dominate the environmental discourse in the 1980s and 1990s.",

Here, we reported our diagnostic experience with psittacosis in combination with central nervous system (CNS) infection and acute cerebral infarction (CI).\n          \n          \n            Case Report:\n            A 62-year-old gentleman presented to our department due to episodic vertigo for 4 hours. Pulmonary CT scan revealed high-density shadows in the right upper lobe, and brain MRI initially excluded new CI lesions. Seven days later, the patient began to show fever, with the highest temperature of 39.3°C. Pulmonary CT scan showed pneumonia. Cerebral MR was performed as the patient showed loss of consciousness and convulsion, which indicated pontine infarction. The patient was eventually transferred to the ICU due to severe pneumonia complicated by type I respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) confirmed psittacosis, and then the patient was treated with a regimen of piperacillin-tazobactam, moxifloxacin, and minocycline. However, the patient continued to have a fever and exhibited irritability after withdrawal of sedative medication, thereby, CNS infection was suspected. Upon cerebrospinal fluid collection following lumbar puncture, mNGS sequencing indicated Candida albicans infection. MR revealed progression of infarction featured by increased lesions in the right cerebellum, right pons, right fronto-parietal-temporal-occipital, and right corona radiata.\n          \n          \n            Conclusion:\n            We reported a case report of psittacosis combined with CNS infection based on the mNGS sequencing, along with acute CI based on conventional imaging technique.",

    "abstract": "Lunar crater detection plays a crucial role in geological analysis and the advancement of lunar exploration. Accurate identification of craters is also essential for constructing high-resolution topographic maps and supporting mission planning in future lunar exploration efforts. However, lunar craters often suffer from insufficient feature representation due to their small size and blurred boundaries. In addition, the visual similarity between craters and surrounding terrain further exacerbates background confusion. These challenges significantly hinder detection performance in remote sensing imagery and underscore the necessity of enhancing both local feature representation and global semantic reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel Spatial Channel Fusion and Context-Aware YOLO (SCCA-YOLO) model built upon the YOLO11 framework. Specifically, the Context-Aware Module (CAM) employs a multi-branch dilated convolutional structure to enhance feature richness and expand the local receptive field, thereby strengthening the feature extraction capability. The Joint Spatial and Channel Fusion Module (SCFM) is utilized to fuse spatial and channel information to model the global relationships between craters and the background, effectively suppressing background noise and reinforcing feature discrimination. In addition, the improved Channel Attention Concatenation (CAC) strategy adaptively learns channel-wise importance weights during feature concatenation, further optimizing multi-scale semantic feature fusion and enhancing the model’s sensitivity to critical crater features. The proposed method is validated on a self-constructed Chang’e 6 dataset, covering the landing site and its surrounding areas. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves an mAP0.5 of 96.5% and an mAP0.5:0.95 of 81.5%, outperforming other mainstream detection models including the YOLO family of algorithms. These findings highlight the potential of SCCA-YOLO for high-precision lunar crater detection and provide valuable insights into future lunar surface analysis.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionHistorical artifacts preserved in museums are invaluable cultural treasures but are often susceptible to biodeterioration driven by microbial colonization. Despite increasing awareness of microbial impacts on heritage conservation, systematic microbiological studies of such objects remain limited, particularly in Latin America.MethodsThis study presents the first comprehensive investigation of bacteria inhabiting heritage artifacts from Casa Histórica de la Independencia, Argentina’s Museum of Independence. Samples were collected from a range of materials, including wood, textiles, architectural elements, and exterior walls. Microbial colonization was assessed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and bacterial isolates were phenotypically and taxonomically characterized via VITEK MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Selected isolates were further subjected to genomic analysis.ResultsSEM imaging revealed diverse and well-structured biofilms with intricate three-dimensional architectures embedded in extracellular polymeric substances. A total of 49 bacterial strains were isolated, predominantly Gram-positive genera such as Bacillus, Micrococcus, and Kocuria. The 19th-century albumen print photograph emerged as the most biodiverse artifact, yielding 21 distinct strains, including extremophilic genera such as Streptomyces, Oceanobacillus, and Caldibacillus thermoamylovorans. The albumen layer’s protein-rich and halophilic properties likely promoted microbial colonization. Notably, Pseudomonas species were found exclusively on this photographic material. Human-associated taxa, such as Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus equorum, were primarily detected in high-contact zones, while exterior surfaces exhibited unique microbial profiles, including opportunistic pathogens.DiscussionThe findings highlight a complex and substrate-specific microbial landscape across the museum’s collection. The presence of halophiles and human-associated bacteria points to both intrinsic material properties and external contamination sources. This study shows the importance of incorporating microbiological data into conservation protocols. By characterizing the artifact-associated microbiota, we contribute to the emerging field of heritage microbiology and future bio-informed preservation strategies.",

By constructing a MAEU-GAN model with dynamic perception capability, three core units are integrated: the attention unit realizes key region focusing through dynamic weight allocation in the feature space; the gating unit enhances the model’s discriminative ability using an adaptive feature selection mechanism; and the anomaly discrimination unit quantifies anomaly probabilities by combining residual learning and a hybrid strategy of discriminative loss. On this basis, a dual-path feature localization architecture is designed: on one hand, a local-global feature interaction network is built based on Grad-CAM technology to accurately locate abnormal regions through multidimensional feature intersection operations; on the other hand, a pre-trained Swin Transformer model is introduced, which realizes multi-scale feature representation through its hierarchical window attention mechanism. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves remarkable performance on PV image datasets, with an anomaly detection accuracy of 96.22% and a fault classification accuracy improved to 98.5%, significantly outperforming traditional algorithms in detection accuracy, anomaly sensitivity, and complex fault classification performance.",

    "abstract": "Porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) is an important coronavirus to cause respiratory syndrome in pigs. To analyze the genetic and evolutional characteristics of PRCV in Guangxi province, southern China, a total of 6,267 clinical samples were collected from different pig farms, harmless treatment plants and abattoirs in Guangxi province during 2022–2024. Seventeen positive samples of PRCV were selected to amplify and analyze the S, M, and N gene sequences. The results showed that the positivity rate of PRCV was 1.13% (71/6,267) using RT-qPCR. The homology analysis revealed that the nucleotide (amino acid) identity were 98.2–100% (96.6–100%) among the obtained 17 S, M, and N gene sequences, and 91.3–98.1% (88.8–98.0%) among the obtained strains and the reference strains from different countries. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that all PRCV strains could be divided into two groups, tentatively designated group I and group II, and each group was further divided into different clades. The strains obtained from Guangxi province distributed in group I, and formed an independent clade. They were most closely related to PRCV 137 isolate 86/135308 strain from the United Kingdom basing on the S, M, and N gene sequences. The sequence analysis revealed that all PRCV strains from Guangxi province obtained in this study showed 672 nt/224 aa deletion in the 5′ region of S gene, and there existed 37 amino acid mutations in different regions in S gene of different PCRV strains. Recombination analysis of S gene sequences did not find any recombination event. The Bayesian analysis indicated that all PRCV strains could be divided into Group I and II, and the obtained Guangxi strains belonged to group I. The population size of circulating PRCV strains kept slightly upward trend since its discovery in 1984 until 2010, showed a steady downward trend until 2020, and then a slight increase. The results suggested that the PRCV strains circulating in Guangxi province originated from Europe, and have evolved independently with genetic diversity. These findings enriched the epidemiological data of PRCV, and provided new information on the prevalence and genetic evolution of PRCV in Guangxi province of China.",

    "abstract": "Addressing the challenges posed by the complex and dynamic space environment and the significant errors in space object orbit prediction, this study proposes a method to correct orbit predictions based on the Simplified General Perturbations 4 (SGP4) model. This method utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict positional errors. Focusing primarily on the “Ajisai” satellite as a case study, the LSTM model learns from historical orbital characteristics—including positional error, velocity, and acceleration—to predict positional error for the next day and optimize orbit predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that the LSTM method outperforms the SVM (Support Vector Machine) method, achieving good performance. The orbit errors in the [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text] axes were reduced to 7.14%, 6.77%, and 8.39% of their original values, respectively, using the LSTM approach. We further investigated the impact of the number of hidden layer units on model performance. Additionally, to validate the model’s generalizability, we tested its predictive accuracy using orbital data from the low-Earth orbit satellite Larets. This method provides a valuable reference for research aimed at improving the prediction accuracy of space object orbits.",

It fills the need for a ready to use software for applying AI models to medical images without requiring software and hardware resource setup from the end user.\n               \n               \n                  Methods:\n                  The components of the framework consist of: (i) AI Apps: Analysis workflows involving AI models are packaged as “apps” that are launched in Docker environments and can be configured to use hardware resources from commercial cloud providers like AWS, GCP and Azure. Apps are defined in Common Workflow Language (CWL) and multiple CWL tasks can be chained together in a workflow definition. These Apps are initiated as tasks in the cloud within the CGC - Seven Bridges web portal or externally from users’ local hardware using their API via Python or command line. These apps along with the required data are organized into projects on CGC; and shared with other users on the platform for their use. (ii) Data I/O: The framework allows datasets to be downloaded from public repositories such as TCIA, IDC, Zenodo as well as XNAT instances by using APIs to download images. The CGC-API provides upload and download from users’ local hardware to CGC, allowing easy transfer of user data for AI inference. Trained AI model weights are hosted in access-controlled Box software at our institution and made available to Apps on-demand. Additionally, users can store and programmatically access data on cloud storage provided by GCP and AWS. (iii) Analysis software: GNU-GPL copyright pyCERR, a Python-based computational platform enables researchers to organize, access, and transform metadata from high dimensional, multi-modal datasets. pyCERR provides an extensible data structure for metadata from commonly used Radiological imaging file formats and Napari-based Viewer to allow for multi-modal visualization and programmatic access to graphical user interface objects. Analysis modules in pyCERR provide image segmentation, radiomics, Dynamic Contrast Enhanced MRI features, radiotherapy dose-volume histogram-based features, and normal tissue complication and tumor control models for radiotherapy. Image processing utilities are provided to help train and infer convolutional neural network-based models for image segmentation, registration and transformation.\n               \n               \n                  Results:\n                  The framework provides access to AI models clinically used at our institution for research, non-commercial use. These include segmentation inference for various treatment sites of Organs at Risk in radiotherapy treatment planning, lung tumor nodules and deformable image registration for abdominal MRI in the form of Apps hosted in a CGC project.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusion:\n                  In summary, the presented framework facilitates reproducible deployment of radiological image analyses by pre-configuring components of analyses including hardware resources and computation.\n               \n               \n                  Citation Format:\n                  Aditya Apte, Eve LoCastro, Aditi Iyer, Sharif Elguindi, Jue Jiang, Jung Hun Oh, Harini Veeraraghavan, Amita Shukla-Dave, Joseph O.

    "abstract": "This article provides an in-depth examination of contemporary crash detection models integrated into digital mobile platforms and Internet of Vehicles (IoV) infrastructures. The study first discusses hardware configurations—including accelerometers, GPS modules, and dashcams—and explores how these sensors interact in real-time telematics environments. It then delineates the algorithmic frameworks underlying crash detection, contrasting threshold-based heuristics with machine learning and deep learning approaches. Further, practical facets such as multi-sensor calibration, federated learning for privacy preservation, and adaptable data communication strategies are critically analyzed. The article also highlights integration with external service ecosystems (e.g., emergency assistance, insurance) and addresses legal, privacy, and standardization challenges surrounding crash detection deployment. Taken together, these investigations elucidate the potential of holistic, data-driven systems for reducing false alarms and accelerating life-saving interventions in traffic accidents.",

    "abstract": "AbstractTropical cyclone (TC)‐induced sea surface temperature cooling (TCC) has both local and basin‐scale effects, but the roles of upper ocean conditions and TC intensity in its long‐term variability remain unclear in the Northwest Pacific (NWP). This study finds that annual cumulative basin‐scale TCC has increased (21.51 ± 6.41°C/yr), driven primarily by enhanced TCC in the western coastal and mid‐latitude regions north of 20°N (39.26 ± 6.67°C/yr), while a decreasing trend is observed south of 20°N (−17.75 ± 4.42°C/yr). At the local scale, TCC has intensified (0.08 ± 0.01°C/decade), with extreme events (top 95%) increasing even more (0.09 ± 0.01°C/decade). The probability of typical TCC (&gt;1°C) has almost doubled over the last four decades, and the TCC distribution has shifted rightward, reflecting stronger TCC. These trends are primarily driven by changes in ocean stratification, with variations in TC intensity playing a secondary role.",

    "abstract": "The screening of high-dimensional design variables has garnered significant attention in engineering optimization. However, the challenge of screening design variables while comprehensively considering multi-objective attributes remains unresolved in the multi-objective optimization of automotive seat structures. To address this issue, this study proposes a Comprehensive Sobol Global Sensitivity Analysis (CSGSA) method. Traditional multi-criteria decision-making methods often involve complex weight calculations, further complicating multi-attribute decision-making processes. The proposed CSGSA method integrates the strengths of Sobol global sensitivity analysis and Modified Preference Selection Index (MPSI), eliminating the need for weight calculations and effectively addressing the design variable screening challenge in the multi-objective optimization of automotive seat structures. Based on the aforementioned methods, this paper applies the CSGSA and MPSI methods to the lightweight optimization of automotive seat frame. Firstly, two high-precision finite element simulation models, experimentally validated for modal analysis, are constructed, and the CSGSA method is employed to screen design variables for lightweight optimization. Secondly, several advanced surrogate models are constructed using optimal Latin hypercube sampling, with the third-order Response Surface Model (RSM3) identified as the optimal surrogate model. Furthermore, the Multi-Objective Global Optimization (MOGO) technique, RSM3-Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II, is employed to obtain the Pareto Frontier Solutions (PFSs) for this optimization design. The best compromise solution is then determined from the PFSs using the MPSI method. The optimized automotive seat significantly increased the first-order modal frequency of the entire seat and seat frame by 18.83% and 27.08%, respectively, concurrently achieving a weight reduction of 4.038%. Finally, the optimized automotive seat is subjected to a whiplash test. The test results show high scores, indicating that the seat provides effective protection for the driver and passengers in the event of a collision. Additionally, the optimization results of the proposed MOGO technique are compared with those of the classical multi-objective local optimization technique, highlighting the superior optimization performance of MOGO.",
